0	k4qide	geax3ef	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"“I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community”

How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?"	"> fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights

Worse - ~~he sued, and won, a defamation lawsuit 5 years ago~~ for $7,500 because someone called him gay.

EDIT: my Hungarian is terrible and the tweet I read was incorrect. This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.

He's now #1 on [gayhomophobe.com](https://gayhomophobe.com/)

*According to the first-instance verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Klára Ungár will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*

*Klára Ungár, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted Máté Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*

*Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that Máté Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*"	exploration

40	t0b6fb	hy94pmq	More than 150 senior Russian officials sign open letter condemning Putin's invasion of Ukraine as 'an unprecedented atrocity' and warn of 'catastrophic consequences' while urging citizens 'not to participate'	More than 150 senior Russian officials sign open letter condemning Putin's invasion of Ukraine as 'an unprecedented atrocity' and warn of 'catastrophic consequences' while urging citizens 'not to participate'	"
My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views."	exploration

My only hope is that this dissent is strong enough to bring an end to this horrible regime. Warmongering tyrants need to meet the fate that they deserve to deter any future incursions. Ultimately, I will not be upset if Putin is found hanging from a streetlight by the end of this war.	evaluation

We know. At some point, everyone has thought about it. Human nature implies greed and corruption. This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption. I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings. So I'll just skip to the point.

Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.

Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..

Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.

The Secret Service told him it wasn't possible to fly or at least they strongly advised against it for technical reasons . Fine.

From a political and symbolic point of view, though, it was not too difficult to understand that it was important that he made it and so he should have _told_ them that he _had_ to go and that it was up to them to find a way.

I'm sure that if a war-type crisis had occurred they would have managed to move him anywhere in record time.

If anything, TVs around the world showing a drenched President who had made a special effort (they would of course 
 have said what happened with the helicopter) to pay respect to the fallen would have been PR gold."	evaluation

>The licences have included £18m worth of ammunition, including so-called “rubber bullets”, smoke and pyrotechnic charges, CS gas grenades, and teargas.

>The sale of teargas and rubber bullets specifically is conducted via an “open licence” system meaning the value of exports is not made public – in total three separate licences were approved for this equipment.

>Britain has also licensed £800m of small arms to the US since 2010, a proportion of which campaigners say is likely to have been for police use. The exports have included assault rifles, sniper rifles and other guns. Licences have also covered around £2m in security goods such as riot shields.

>The government’s own licensing criteria says that exports should not be granted if there is a “clear risk that items might be used for internal repression”. The government has the power to urgently review licences where situations change.

How much of this export is actually made in Scotland?"	I find it crazy that a country that has made most firearms illegal, and constantly hounds America about it produces, I'm guessing, in excess of £800 million worth of small arms. How are the citizens ok with that?	evaluation

Not Australian, but I'm inclined to agree with this as well.

"I would like to dedicate a comment to warn you about a technique that was used in Europe to stop Net Neutrality.
I read a lot on here that the effect would be that you'd end up paying extra for 'packages' or certain sites. The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.
However there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!
It sounds great but;
1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!
2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.
3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.

Net neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.
 
So yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!"	exploration

"I would like to dedicate a comment to warn you about a technique that was used in Europe to stop Net Neutrality.
I read a lot on here that the effect would be that you'd end up paying extra for 'packages' or certain sites. The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.
However there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!
It sounds great but;
1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!
2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.
3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.

Net neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.
 
So yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers. So beware and make sure every not-tech-savvy person is informed on the risk!"	evaluation

"So, I know this strategy isn't a thing - and won't happen. But in a perfect world, if it did....

Google and Facebook should just blacklist Verizon/Comcast customers. Atleast for a period of time. Akin to what they did a few years back with the blackout. You can get thru - but everytime you visit those sites, Facebook and Google automatically throttle blacklisted users at 800kbps and give a nice little thought of the day quote on Net Neurtrality. ""This is what your Internet Service Provider is lobbying for. Don't like it? Call your congressman.""  Now wait 300 seconds until Captcha Robot appears, thank you.

Sorry in advance if you have Verizon/Comcast. These are the 2 largest lobbyists for the demise of Net Neutrality, as far as ISPs - I'm aware."	exploration

Here are 2 petitions to sign, one international and one exclusively US.

International: https://www.savetheinternet.com/sti-home

US: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/do-not-repeal-net-neutrality

Text ""resist"" to 504-09. It's a bot that will send a formal email, fax, and letter to your representatives. It also finds your representatives for you. All you have to do is text it and it holds your hand the whole way.

WAY too many people are simply upvoting and hoping that'll be enough, this is the closest level of convenience to upvoting you can find WHILE actually making a difference.

This effects us all. DO. YOUR. PART.

These are the emails of the 5 people on the FCC roster. These are the five people deciding the future of the internet.

The two women have come out as No votes. We need only to convince ONE of the other members to flip to a No vote to save Net Neutrality.

Blow up their inboxes!

"I have hesitated talking about certain past life experiences for the sake of just not putting any sort of spot light but you know what, fuck it, this is important. I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.

Now, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.

First of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.

First of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??

Censorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.

Will there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?

This is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to ""unlock reddit"".

I try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.

I am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse. Please Americans, do not do this to yourselves, value what you have without having to learn just how much it means to all of you because it was taken away."	exploration

And since you have to apply, no.

Norway is running a surplus budget so we thought about hosting it a few years back. But then the IOC came with their demands, which we told them to stick up their asses. 

The ESC, however, is a punishment. Since the next competition happens in the country of whoever wins, anyone could end up hosting. Competing doesn't cost much, but hosting is really really expensive. Not to mention you only have 1 year to do it. Thus, nations have refused to host after winning. 

The UK, France, Germany, Spain and Italy also pay a lot of the bill, so they get to go straight to the final. Which is more of a punishment for the UK, as they suck and keep coming in dead last. The others usually do quite well."	Sorry I am not a sports person at all, esc?	evaluation

Can you comment and why the Roche family charged save the redwoods so much for the property? Yeah it's valuable land and they deserve to get something for it but $15 million is a lot of dough. On the other hand maybe that is the commercial value of the land there? Thanks for your opinion!	"I can’t speak to the motivations of the Rouchs, but I think it’s worth keeping in mind that this land had been in the family for a long time, and it was (AFAIK) most of the family’s wealth, so it makes sense that they wanted to get something if they let it go.

It’s also worth mentioning that they did have several bidders for the land, and they were looking to sell it for about two years before this deal was finalized—the negotiations were long. So, although $15M might seem like a lot, it is the market value of the land."	evaluation

(1) Near Threatened

(2) Vulnerable

(3) Endangered

(4) Critically Endangered

(5) Extinct in the Wild

(6) Extinct

The Giraffe is currently at rank 2 ""vulnerable"" which the IUCN defines as ""likely to become endangered unless the circumstances that are threatening its survival and reproduction change.""  

I would say that this is a pretty big ""no shit"" as this label should apply to basically every animal unless humans do something to combat climate change.

"The only thing nihilsm accomplishes is an inflation of the egos of the Very Smart Boys who think they have it all figured out.

You, personally, have two possible ways to think about it:

A.) It doesn't matter. Nothing changes. There's no hope.

B.) This is unacceptable. This needs to change. I'm going to keep talking about this, keep my eyes open for other parts of life that this rot has crept into and get loud about those as well.

If everyone chooses A, they'll be right. Good for them, they get a cookie and a pat on the head.

If everyone chooses B, there's still a chance nothing will change and all that happens is you spend your life aware of how good things could be, but there's also a chance, however small, that change will come. A chance that does not exist in A.

If that's all we have to hope for then you'd better fucking throw yourself into that hope.

14500 employees, let’s say Green pays them £10 an hour on average - not stellar but still well above minimum wage. 40 hours a week for four weeks (this takes place in an ideal world where everything bar nothing shuts down and billionaires aren’t penny pinching wankers) is a total of 160 hours per head, a total of £1600 per head, for a total loss to Green of £23.2m. 

As of 2018, Green was worth about £4bn. This figure therefore amounts to about 0.6% of his wealth. 

0.6% of the money this man owns would pay all the workers he’s laid off for a month at a £10 hourly rate.

Cyril himself is cowed by the corrupt factions within the ANC. Our parliament will table the land expropriation act this year which might be the final bullet to this pathetic excuse of a transition.

If indeed they would like to learn something from us, we are on the ready to provide them with our own experience and how we were able to navigate a very difficult situation that confronted us at the dawn of our democracy.

He doesn't say what this very difficult situation is, but it could have been the Storming of Kempton Park WTC in 1993 by a group of fascists while negotiations between the National Party and the ANC were going on - with Ramaphosa being the ANC chief negotiator.

All it takes is for measles or some other deadly disease to mutate and we can forget about our current vaccines.

There’s this story that some Church goers need to hear... 

A man got stranded in a flood and as the flood waters rises he climbed to the top of his house. 

A man in a raft came by and offered to rescue him. 

“Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the raft went on. 

Then a boat came by and offered to save him. 


“Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the boat went on. Flood waters continued to rise and a helicopter came by and offered to save him. He gave the same excuse that God would save him. Helicopter went on and eventually the flood waters rose higher and he drowned. 

He got to heaven and asked God “Why didn’t you save me? I believed in you trusted that you would.” 

Now all you smart people out there already figured out the ending to this. 

And God said “I tried, I sent a raft, a boat, and a helicopter to save you but you turned them all down.”

I keep hearing stories about people who say Christians shouldn’t be afraid because God will protect us... that’s not how this works. All churches should close. They shouldn’t be exempt from this. Use common sense people. If you believe in God then you should believe God sent experts and scientists to give you the proper advice on how to avoid this."	I believe in God.

You drink the beers and once you're done instead of throwing them away you conveniently place them back in the crate. Once you've drunk all 24 you bring the crate back to the supermarket and get you 4 euros back. Why can't they implement this system everywhere on every drink?

* There are no promotions at Aldi. They don't do 50% off, Buy One Get One Free. If you go to Sainsburys with all the promotions you often end up paying way less then the ticket price. Aldi just does away with all of that to show low prices.

* Aldi only stock a limited range of own brand products. Whilst it offers less consumer choice it massively reduces prices. Contracts to supply Aldi are some of the most fought over in the food industry. This is because suppliers know they will not be competing for shelf space, so if Aldi stock it, it will get sold. The limited range also simplifies their supply chain further reducing cost and delays.

* Aldi operate smaller stores in less prime locations. The smaller product range means stores can be smaller so are cheaper to operate/build. The stores are also placed away from high streets often in old industrial estates where property prices are cheaper. Most customers drive so don't care. Aldi also own all their stores so don't have to worry about landlords raising rent.

* Aldi operate a ""Just in time"" supply chain. Stock is unloaded straight off trucks on to shelves. Deliveries are frequent about once every 2 hours. This means they can be fluid with stock. If something isn't selling they can pull it quickly and replace it with something that is.

* All Aldi staff are trained to do every job and are constantly working. They can operate check outs at peak times and unload lorries at off peak. They can clean and stock shelves. This mean they employ less people to keep costs low. Most stores will have max 10 staff working at a time compared to the 100+ in Tesco's or Sainsbury's.

* Everything in Aldi is optimised for speed. Bar codes are placed on every side of a product. Crates are loaded straight on to shelves, instead of carefully placing every item one by one. Checkouts are fast and customers spend less time in store allowing a higher throughput. I personally do my weekly shop in 20 minutes, compared to potentially an hour in tescos.

* Aldi only stock basic groceries. Whilst they do have special buys, these are carefully planned for specific times of year. They don't routinely stock clothing or toys/games. Groceries are predictable as people buy them every week allowing for consistent revenue compared to the unstable nature of fashion/gifts which people only buy a couple time a year.

* Aldi is very good to their staff. Whilst they work hard they are also paid way above the industry average. They provide a good work/life balance and regular training and other benefits. The Aldi Area manager grad scheme is one of the most competitive in the country. They offer a £44,000 ($56K) starting salary and company car, rising to £77,000 after 3 years ($99K). As a grad you start at the bottom stocking shelves, quickly doing every job up till Area manager of around 5-6 stores. This is not just to be nice, it attracts the best candidates for the job.

I was head of quality for one of the Aldi countries for a couple of years. At that time (4-5 years ago) sustainability was a complete novel thing that was just a side task of one of the buyers. They started hiring a small sustainability team that made quite some local impact.

Though i have to be critical at the set goal. A goal of making all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable can be abused. Technically almost all plastics are recyclable, therefore it would meet such a requirement. The goal is to **ensure** that the packaging is indeed recycled, reused or composted, which is much harder. 

I have worked with many packaging suppliers, they all try this trick of marketing their packaging as recyclable. Which is technically true, but in practice 0% of that packaging would be recycled as there was no return stream set up or no recyclers accepting that material."	exploration

Then there's a 2nd post of Ukrainians helping the driver to get out. I'm so glad that the elder civilian was okay (or so it was said). 

Next I saw a 3rd footage, which happened just before the running over. There were several (supposedly russian) soldiers driving a military truck,  and being gunned down (so many shots were fired even onto their dead bodies). The ones who shot them (not sure if they are ukrainian army or civilians) were walking around the trunk, which was just on the road next to the tank which at the same moment run over the civilian car, but they didn't pay any attention to the tank, neither acoid nor attack it. I felt weird but didn't really think much.

Then I saw people questioning that these tanks didn't have russian labels (or whatever they use to tell apart different military vehicles)?

The question that remains now is *what are we going to do about it?*

The consensus among [scientists](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf) and [economists](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) on [carbon pricing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_price)^§ to mitigate climate change is similar to [the consensus among climatologists](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/) that human activity is responsible for global warming. Putting the price [upstream](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean. Returning the revenue as an equitable dividend [offsets any regressive effects of the tax](http://www.nber.org/papers/w9152.pdf) (in fact, [~60% of the public would receive more in dividend than they paid in tax](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081648#s7)) and allows for a higher carbon price (which [is what matters for climate mitigation](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S201000781840002X)) because [the public isn't willing to pay anywhere near what's needed otherwise](http://www.apnorc.org/projects/Pages/Is-the-Public-Willing-to-Pay-to-Help-Fix-Climate-Change-.aspx). Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own. And [**a carbon tax accelerates the adoption of every other solution**](https://www.drawdown.org/frequently-asked-questions).

[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years, [starting about now](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is [returned as an equitable dividend to households](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the [poor tend to spend money when they've got it](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cstwMPC.pdf), which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)) not to mention [create jobs](https://econ.ucalgary.ca/manageprofile/sites/econ.ucalgary.ca.manageprofile/files/unitis/publications/1-7729354/Yamazaki_CarbonTax_JEEM_2017.pdf) and [save lives](https://globalchange.mit.edu/news-media/jp-news-outreach/shift-renewable-electricity-win-win-statewide-level). 

Taxing carbon [is in each nation's own best interest](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf) (it [saves lives at home](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09499-x)) and [many nations have already started](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29687/9781464812927.pdf?sequence=5&isAllowed=y), which [can have knock-on effects in other countries](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). In poor countries, [taxing carbon is progressive even *before* considering smart revenue uses](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf), because only the ""rich"" can afford fossil fuels](s) in the first place. We [won’t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG). Each year we delay costs [~$900 billion](https://cla.umn.edu/heller-hurwicz/news-events/news/policy-brief-calibrating-price-climate-risk).
 
[It's the smart thing to do](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069698910580), and the IPCC report made clear [pricing carbon is **necessary** if we want to meet our 1.5 ºC target](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/SR15_TS_High_Res.pdf).

Contrary to [popular belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance#Examples) the main barrier isn't lack of public support. But [we can't keep hoping others will solve this problem for us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility). We need to take the necessary steps to make this dream a reality:

§ The IPCC (AR5, WGIII) [Summary for Policymakers](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) states with ""high confidence"" that tax-based policies are effective at decoupling GHG emissions from GDP (see p. 28). [Ch. 15](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) has a more complete discussion. The U.S. [National Academy of Sciences, one of the most respected scientific bodies in the world, has also called for a carbon tax](https://www.nap.edu/download/21712). According to [IMF research](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/05/how-much-does-world-subsidize-oil-coal-and-gas/589000/), most of the $5.2 trillion in subsidies for fossil fuels come from not taxing carbon as we should. There is general agreement among economists on carbon taxes whether you consider [economists with expertise in climate economics](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf), [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&rep=rep1&type=pdf), or [economists from all sectors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Doris_Geide-Stevenson/publication/261884738_Consensus_Among_Economists-An_Update/links/56a7f3fa08ae860e0255a8e3.pdf).

The new form of denialism is people saying that we can't do anything about it. It's a way to acknowledge the science but still not do anything.

So it's particularly important that you stress that there's still hope. Global warming is a continual process, so it can *always* get worse. Even if we miss literally every target and hit the worst-case scenario projections, it could *still* get worse. Better we do something late than never."	exploration

Russia in 1917 lost when the people turned against them when they found out their country and it’s leaders were lying to them, failing to end a war how quickly they said they would and continued to harm Russia and it’s people in a war they didn’t want to be in.

695	t8dwjp	hznz5dy	Anonymous has hacked Russian streaming services to broadcast footage of the war	That's true most everywhere. The difference in Russia is that the only leader with solid footing in modern times was Lenin. Tsar Nicolas 2 was hated and on his way out eventually,Stalin merely had everyone too scared to step up and could control what was reported. Everyone after Stalin had flimsy control until Yeltsin who was too drunk to lead Russia and Putin tried to be Stalin but he doesn't have that fear and he can't control the narrative.	"It’s less that people after Stalin had flimsy control and more that they were less strict in their control. They didn’t fail what to replicate what Stalin was doing, they didn’t want to do what Stalin was doing. They lived through their friends and people they worked with disappearing for no reason and nobody saying a word.

There were definitely leaders since then who were well loved and supported, Khrushchev and Gorbachev particularly are some of the best Russia has had in the past centuries.

As for Putin controlling the narrative, Russians in Russia have definitely bought it hook line and sinker. If you look at documentaries before the war started, they support him wholeheartedly and buy what he’s selling. It’s quite sad. But there does seem to be a lot more pushback on that recently, and stuff like going into another country on a “peacekeeping mission”, which is really hard to actually reason, and this will strike a hard blow."	evaluation

People are acting perfectly rationally within the context in which they find themselves. First of all, people need to be prepared to isolate for weeks and most people need a lot of food for that. Second of all, if *other* people are panic buying, your food supply becomes threatened and it becomes rational to stockpile.

Without explicit rations, who's to say what's hoarding and what's legitimate preparation? I've got about 8 days food (and I've been around people who have developed a cough so may need to isolate soon). If I could give some of that food to a poor little granny with only 4 days supply left then I would without a thought, but if I just leave it on the shelf it might get snapped up by a hoarder with 3 weeks supply while I'm forced to go out again and infect people so I can eat."	exploration

1 stay home (unless you are an essential worker)
2 wash your hands regularly 
3 wear a mask when you absolutely have to leave the house for emergencies 
4 stay 2 meters apart from people at all times


That is it. That is literally all you need to do. It’s not impossible.

930	eljp1u	fdiu0ki	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	"So let's take a moment and speculate about the realities at play here.

1) Thanks to the last several decades of war our country has undertaken, we have gotten VERY good at defending against these types of attacks. We have multiple capabilities available to destroy the ballistic missiles used by the majority of our adversaries. From the Phalanx systems to Patriots to airborne anti-missile technology, this is at best a minimal effort on behalf of Iran. Be concerned when they send multiples of dozens toward a limited number of targets.

2) Iran is not stupid, neither are their leaders or their people. More than that, THEY do not want this to escalate. Decades of sanctions and restrictions on them have taken their toll, the last thing they want is war. They KNOW it will be the end of their current regime and their immense regional influence will wane quickly. They're in a good spot geopolitically, even AFTER the killing of Major General Soleimani. Their leaders and diplomats are playing this well so far, including a limited retaliatory strike against only military targets nearby. They also had to be well aware of my statements in #1 above, but they've played their hand and are likely hoping this can be the end of it.

3) The US President also knows he's gotten himself cornered at this point, the lack of casualties so far in this missile attack gives him breathing room though. He's overlooked minimal damage to the drone in the past and the calculus here is MUCH greater. I also believe that the heavy rotation of the video of him saying that President Obama would do this very thing is him making himself look stupid. He's got no way out of that video because it's not come CNN analyst saying that a failing President would engage in conflict with Iran, it is literally HIMSELF. Even he won't accuse himself of fake news...though no one mention deep fakes to him. I seriously think his video from 2011 has an affect on his decision making in this situation.

4) Anyone criticizing our military leaders for offering him the OPTION to kill MG Soleimani should understand the military decision making process first. In military planning, at some level, you ALWAYS include throw away courses of action. They aren't COAs that aren't viable, but they're usually intended to drive thought and consideration for the more palatable options. In this case they made a blunder assuming that the CinC would have even a rudimentary understanding of this process three years into the job.

So, I am hoping for hopes sake that this is the end of kinetic operations in this cluster fuck of a situation. Iran appears to be more level headed and strategic here than our President and that bodes well unless we choose not to seize on the opportunity for diplomacy here. I'm nervous about the next day or two, but I'm optimistic based on all my worldly observations and experiences."	exploration

Let's wait for the casualty reports because  if no American Soldiers died then this is actually an excellent opportunity for de-escalation, the Iranians got their ""revenge"" at the cost of no American lives, a small price to pay for assasinating the general......If Trump responds to this with more attacks than it would be more about his ego than US national security.

EDIT: Some have pointed out that there is a report floating around about 20 or so casualties.....I have not seen that report. With that being said, if this is true, they are probally Iraqi soldiers.....when American Soldiers are killed in combat there are strict procedures required before releasing it to the public (due to next of kin notifications).....If American Soldiers were killed, we won't know until the Pentagon releases a statement"	evaluation

In the long run, since Ukraine has 4 nuclear plants that operate 15 total nuclear reactors, Ukraine will be a net exporter of electricity to the rest of Europe once they are rid of the Russian invaders occupying their nuclear plants—thus reducing some of Europe’s dependence on Russian resources to power European power plants.	exploration
