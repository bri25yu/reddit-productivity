0	k4qide	geax3ef	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"“I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community”

How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?"	"> fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights

Worse - ~~he sued, and won, a defamation lawsuit 5 years ago~~ for $7,500 because someone called him gay.

EDIT: my Hungarian is terrible and the tweet I read was incorrect. This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.

He's now #1 on [gayhomophobe.com](https://gayhomophobe.com/)

*According to the first-instance verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Klára Ungár will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*

*Klára Ungár, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted Máté Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*

*Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that Máté Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*"	exploration

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views."	exploration

My only hope is that this dissent is strong enough to bring an end to this horrible regime. Warmongering tyrants need to meet the fate that they deserve to deter any future incursions. Ultimately, I will not be upset if Putin is found hanging from a streetlight by the end of this war.	evaluation

We know. At some point, everyone has thought about it. Human nature implies greed and corruption. This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption. I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings. So I'll just skip to the point.

Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.

Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..

Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.

My point is, Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself and doesn't even understand what the word sacrifice means since everything he's ever had was either handed to him, or he cheated, lied and stole to get it. 

Maybe people are being critical of him not showing up to the cemetery, but he probably did all those dead soldiers a favour by not walking across their graves.

>The sale of teargas and rubber bullets specifically is conducted via an “open licence” system meaning the value of exports is not made public – in total three separate licences were approved for this equipment.

>Britain has also licensed £800m of small arms to the US since 2010, a proportion of which campaigners say is likely to have been for police use. The exports have included assault rifles, sniper rifles and other guns. Licences have also covered around £2m in security goods such as riot shields.

Sydney absolutely relies on the fireworks as it's main tourist draw, not just for the fireworks themselves but to showcase the city globally for other visitors.

People book up years in advance, what are you going to tell those tourists? There is no link between the fireworks and bushfires, and the smoke from the fireworks is tiny compared to even a small bushfire.

Cancelling the fireworks would be tantamount NSW shooting itself in the foot. Tourism is a vital segment of the economy, visitor numbers will be depressed enough already, without effectively covering the shop window.

"Protest Idea: MASS CANCELLATION DAY

Big internet companies are not fighting hard enough or at all for net neutrality.  Remember when Reed Hastings from Netflix suddenly didn't care about net neutrality?  What do you think about organizing a protest against their indifference/inaction with a day of mass cancellations.

If Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Amazon, Xbox Live, PSN, HBO, etc lost MILLIONS of customers in a single day with the promise that we are not coming back until NN is the law again, they would be forced to throw their full weight behind stopping this crap.

It could not be more obvious that our government is ignoring us while it inflicts great harm upon us for the benefit of ISPs.  It's time to speak with our wallets to people who cannot ignore the language of money.  These services will all be used against us anyway when Verizon and Comcast and the others can charge us extra or throttle them or just block them outright.

Sadly these companies and their money have more influence over our leaders than we ever will.  We need to force them into fighting for us.  You want our business back?  Get on the front lines and put a permanent stop to this!  Now!!"	"You've got to cancel your internet service, not your subscriptions.

Because the cable companies on day 1 are going to go to Netflix and say ""You're using up the most of our bandwidth out of anyone. We're going to throttle your speed unless you pay us $2/mo per customer"" and Netflix will be like ""fuck you"" and there will be a standoff between the two companies until there is a behind-closed-doors agreement reached.

If we cancel our Netflix subscriptions and not our cable internet, the cable companies will have all the leverage in that behind-closed-doors negotiation. "	evaluation

>At the heart of this movement is the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), an international Uyghur organisation that claims to be engaged in a “peaceful, nonviolent, and democratic” struggle for “human rights.” The WUC considers China’s northwestern Xinjiang region to be East Turkestan, and sees its Uyghur Muslim inhabitants not as Chinese citizens but instead as members of a pan-Turkic nation stretching from Central Asia to Turkey. 

>The WUC is not a grassroots movement, but a US government-backed umbrella for several Washington-based outfits that also rely heavily on US funding and direction. Today, it is the main face and voice of a separatist operation dedicated to destabilising the Xinjiang region of China and ultimately toppling the Chinese government.

>While seeking to orchestrate a colour revolution with the aim of regime change in Beijing, the WUC and its offshoots have forged ties with the Grey Wolves, a far-right Turkish organisation that has been actively engaged in sectarian violence from Syria to East Asia.

>None of these links seem to have troubled the WUC’s sponsors in Washington. If anything, they have added to the network’s appeal, consolidating it as one of the most potent political weapons the US wields in its new Cold War against China.

>From its inception, the WUC has been backed by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). With millions in US taxpayer money, the NED and its subsidiaries have backed opposition parties, “civil society” groups, and media organisations in countries targeted by the US for regime change.

>Philip Agee, the late CIA whistleblower, described the work of the NED as a more sophisticated version of the old-fashioned covert operations that Langley used to engineer. “Nowadays,” Agee explained, “instead of having the CIA going around behind the scenes and trying to manipulate the process by inserting money here and giving instructions secretly and so forth, they have now a sidekick, which is this National Endowment for Democracy, NED.”"	"Your post is gonna be controversial, but you're right.

I'm not gonna say China is a benevolent state, but a whole hell of a lot of the information about these internment camps and human rights violations comes directly from US government backed organizations. Many of which were also, famously, involved in producing anti-soviet propaganda during the cold War, as well as the information ""proving"" Iraq had WMDs in the leadup to the invasion or Iraq, and most recently the now debunked information accusing Morales of cheating in the election in Bolivia in order to justify regime change.

I don't want to say it's *all* fake, but I pretty much couldn't think of a less trustworthy source. And seeing those sources of information make it to the front page and then all the top comments call for open war with China..... it just paints a bad picture. Reeks of public manipulation.

To be fair, there wasn’t as much international pressure against racism at the time. IIRC FDR didn’t meet with Jesse Owens after ‘36 and when Owens was in college he had to ride in segregated buses.

220	7em7xi	dq6bd09	Belgium says loot boxes are gambling, wants them banned in Europe	"What we hope: To see an end to Loot Boxes as a feature in full priced games

What we'll get: Overwatch removed from Europe."	"I’m really curious about how this could affect overwatch in different ways. I choose not to buy loot boxes, so from my selfish perspective, I appreciate all the people buying them and paying for all the updates and events that I get for free. 

But at the same time, if there are kids out there stealing money from their parents to buy loot boxes, then that means I am profiting off of that. 

If they changed to direct purchase of in game items, they no doubt would make less money, but I wonder if maybe more people would take part in the micro transactions. Would they still make enough to fully support the game at the level they do currently?

I also wonder how a season pass model would work. I would be perfectly fine with a $20 annual pass, but how many others would? 

My unfortunate assumption is that the majority of players benefit most from the current system at the expense of those minority “whales” and those who spend an irresponsible amount on loot boxes. 

So the question is, if loot boxes are removed, what could possibly take their place that would provide Blizzard with enough post-sale revenue to maintain overwatch at the current level?

(Keep in mind that all these thoughts relate strictly to overwatch’s micro transaction model, none of that EA p2w garbage.)"	exploration

&nbsp;

The minister of Justice wants to ban in-game purchases, if you don't know exactly what it will contain. ""Combining gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.

&nbsp;

The commotion started last week with the new game Star Wars: Battlefront in the the game you could buy so called ""loot boxes"", virtual boxes which could contain advantages for the game. You don't know however what it contains beforehand.

&nbsp;

""The combination of money and addiction is gambling"", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.

&nbsp;

Geens now wants to prevent that these kinds of functions will be in any games going forward. ""But that takes time, because we'll have to make a proposal to the EU. We will definitely try to ban it.""

&nbsp;

Edit: changed some wording for clarification and accuracy.

Now, I am not deleting my facebook account. Facebook is a tool that I like.

I am on my alternate account, and the reason is, I am kind of ""in industry"". I work with clients who use facebook and other tools to advertise.

It's important to note that this plugin doesn't really solve the whole ""Cambridge Analytica"" thing. That cat is already out of the bag. That data is out there. There was a great article on the atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/arch that kind of explained what happened there. Essentially, back in the the early facebook days, they were trying to establish an ecosystem of apps. These were things like iq tests,games, etc, but also included things like registering for a third party website. When you installed one of those apps, you gave facebook permission to give that 3rd party your information. Once it was given, there is no way to get it back.That was things like your school, your contact information and your friends. When facebook transitioned to mobile first, that ""installing apps"" thing kind of stopped. The extension does nothing to solve this problem.

Now, there is another dimension, which is facebook tracking on pages that aren't facebook. This used to be commonly done with ""share on facebook buttons"". Now, it's a lot less transparent. It is very commonly set up so that when you visit a site, facebook knows. Then, someone can target you with an ad on facebook based on that information. For example, you go to a tee-shirt store. You don't buy the tee shirt. And, then you go on facebook and see an ad for that teeshirt. I believe this is what the plugin is designed to solve.

Another thing that facebook does is it takes lists from other people. You load the lists in, and then facebook can do a few things. It can serve ads to those people. But, it can also find people who are similar to those people. And then it can serve ads based on either of those. So in the t-shirt example, if someone visits the store and makes a purchase. You can take a list of all those people, load it into facebook and find other people who look similar. Then, serve ads to those people. This extension does nothing to fix this. 

Most of the actual advertising that is done with facebook is actually on one of their properties (basically instagram and facebook). I believe that facebook has some ability to serve ads off facebook, but I have actually heard very little about it. Theoretically, this extension would help, but Google really dominates that market. So, this would be a drop in the bucket.

So someone extremely close to Epstein, and has been accused by many people of procuring and trafficking children for him is going to come out and say that one of the trafficked girls is lying about who she was forced to have sex with. 

So is she planning on coming out and saying she setup the rapes and so knows exactly who was raping the kids? Is she planning on saying she had absolutely nothing to do with the rapes and didn't know any of it was happening BUT she also knows Prince Pedo didn't do any of it?

Now for the facts and figures:

Trump owe a 30% stake in a real estate asset that is partially financed by Bank of China. 

This is **extremely** common in ANY large scale financing. Either the lead bank(s) lends the money, and then syndicates the loan out to dozens of banks, or a club of banks get together at the beginning and finance it. 

Trump does NOT owe Bank of China 30% of $950m. That would be if he borrowed directly from them. He has a partial stake in an asset that has a $950m loan on it. That’s very different. If you owned shares in Tesla, even as a tiny holder, would you say you owe money to Tesla’s creditors?

1. Trump is a minority shareholder in this. Vornado Realty Trust, is who’s controlling debt leveraging decisions etc. trump owns 30%.

2. The position the bank took was ~20% of a mortgage.  So for the total debt 6% is chinas share of trumps interest of the buildings value.

3. The bank reported that they collateralized and sold the debt (very common for large commercial deals, banks underwrite) and said it was a discrepancy that they were listed as still having a claim.

Trump isn’t exactly a saint, but the press and democrats don’t exactly give themselves great legitimacy by reposting bullshit that is meaningless. I’m sure my mortgage has been bundled into a CDO and it wouldn’t shock me if 2% of it is held by Carlos Slim. That doesn’t mean I owe Carlos slim any favors.

"My country also had a peaceful transition of power, granted it was a result of an anti-socialist revolution, but I still believe the world could also learn a thing or two from it:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet\_Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution)

Please, I urge you not to fall into the fake belief that socialism is the answer to your problems. The generation of my parents literally had to bleed on the streets to get our generation rid of socialism and ensure a future for us. We all thank them for their sacrifice every single day. 

I just returned from an excursion to Devin Castle in Slovakia, which is at the border between former Czechoslovakia and Austria. It shows all the people who tried to escape socialism while risking their lives, only to be torn apart alive by dogs, or shot to pieces by border guards (if they got lucky). Yet people still kept risking being torn apart by dogs just to escape socialism, they kept thinking of innovative ways to escape (like home-made diving suits which caused the to drown, or home-made rogallos which caused them to be shot to death before their dead bodies even reached the Austrian side of the river). 

The rise of the radical right in the US makes me sick as half of my family suffered immensely in camps the last time it happened in our part of Europe. And the rise of the radical left makes me equally sick as socialists did more harm to us than the nazis ever could. Please, I beg you, don't fall into this trap. My chess coach always said ""A smart man learns from his mistakes, a smarter man learns from mistakes of others"". Please learn from our mistakes, the entire world will benefit from that. Please listen to people who experienced what you wish for. We are not idiots, we are people just like you and we have experienced the thing you are wishing for right now.

1. This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address.
2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving).
3. From the paper itself: ""We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment."" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already.
4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.

For context, from what small amount I know of the Choctaw's struggles, their relocation through the Trail of Tears happened during 1830-33 (broad dates) while our famine was approximately during 1845-49. The Choctaw tribe had experienced thousands of deaths during relocation and were about as destitute as one could imagine. I think that makes the donation all the more powerful. These people had nothing except for heartbreak and betrayal and when the plight of others reached their settlements they rallied together to give almost everything they had. All this born out of the understanding of pain the Irish were suffering and not wishing to see another race of people face those same torments. 

I'm not one for big internet posts or to get too emotional about this sort of stuff, but there's a special place in my heart for the Choctaw tribe and other Native Americans. I think it's one of the purest examples of the kindness and solidarity of people, something the modern world has forgotten a bit too often."	I completely agree.

All it takes is for measles or some other deadly disease to mutate and we can forget about our current vaccines.

There’s this story that some Church goers need to hear... 

A man got stranded in a flood and as the flood waters rises he climbed to the top of his house. 

A man in a raft came by and offered to rescue him. 

“Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the raft went on. 

Then a boat came by and offered to save him. 


“Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the boat went on. Flood waters continued to rise and a helicopter came by and offered to save him. He gave the same excuse that God would save him. Helicopter went on and eventually the flood waters rose higher and he drowned. 

He got to heaven and asked God “Why didn’t you save me? I believed in you trusted that you would.” 

Now all you smart people out there already figured out the ending to this. 

And God said “I tried, I sent a raft, a boat, and a helicopter to save you but you turned them all down.”

I keep hearing stories about people who say Christians shouldn’t be afraid because God will protect us... that’s not how this works. All churches should close. They shouldn’t be exempt from this. Use common sense people. If you believe in God then you should believe God sent experts and scientists to give you the proper advice on how to avoid this."	evaluation

I know Reddit loves to hate big corporations especially Coca-Cola and has a massive disdain for plastic products, but to see this article with this source of data on the front page once again is really discouraging and really highlights the fact that there are many users who do not read what they upvote.


This article claims that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter**. This is a pretty bold claim, so let's see how they determined that fact:


The article cites a yearly study performed once again in which a supposidly accurate determination of plastic polluters is identified by using plastic bottles that have washed up on beaches. 


This year's study was performed by collecting 346,494 plastic bottles from beaches. Among those, 218,291 of them were able to be identified by brand. Of those identifiable bottles Coca-Cola brand products made up 13,843 of the bottles found on the beach. 

Although many of these smaller numbers are cleverly danced-around or completely omitted in the data source, this comes out to be a total of **4% of the total bottles collected were identified as belonging to Coca-Cola brand products.**


4% may not seem like a lot to begin with, but let's also consider a few other factors: Anyone who has ever been to a store in the past 10 years can tell you with certainty that Coca-Cola brand does a very good job of trademarking their product. Every Coca-Cola brand drink (including their teas, sports drinks, juices, and bottled water) has a unique style plastic bottle, and this is reflected across all of their sizes from 12 oz, to 24 oz, to 2 l bottles. This plastic bottle design makes their product visually different from the competitors' bottles who mostly use the same generic shape. When exposed to saltwater and constant sunlight many plastic bottles fade, fall apart, lose their labels, or the labels fade to clear. Because the bottles are discarded, bottle caps with brands on them are often missing as well. Those that have bottle caps are also usually faded and brand stamps worn away. 


Despite the harsh weathering there is one persistent detail among the bottles that makes them uniquely and easily identifiable and that is **the shape of the plastic bottle itself**. and as we know Coca-Cola is one of the few brands that has a unique easily identifiable plastic bottle shape. What this means in the context of the study is that every single Coca-Cola product bottle from the past decade was easily identified by their bottle shape, however other leading competitor brands which do not feature a unique bottle shape relied entirely on the label print for identification. this means that 100% of the Coca-Cola products found on the beach were correctly identified as Coca-Cola brand products, however it's very likely that only a small percentage of waste from other brand products were able to be identified due to weathering.


So not only are the results fairly insignificant at only 4%, but they are also extremely biased and unreliable.


Using this data the study claimed that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluting brand**. Ignoring the flawed data for a moment let's take a look at what this claim means in regards to this particular study with an analogy:


*Imagine you're walking into work one morning and you notice a large pile of cigarette butts lying on the ground around the smoker's pole in the parking lot. Being the good samaritan that you are you pick up the trash. You count that you've picked up 100 cigarette butts. Out of those cigarette butts 37 of them are just plain orange or white design with no identifiable information. However, 63 of them have a brand name or logo printed on them. There's a very large variety of brands, many of which you've never even heard of, however 4 out of the 100 are Marlboro. With all the different brands mixed in Marlboro makes up the largest number of the identifiable cigarette butts.* **Using this information you determine that Marlboro cigarette company must be the number one litter producer in the world.**

______

While the results of the study are interesting and important, they do not and never have supported the claim that Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter. Using the data in this way only proves one or more of the following points:

1) Coca-Cola produces the most popular brands of bottled products.

2) Coca-Cola product consumers litter more often than consumers of other products.

3) Coca-Cola brand products have the most easily identifiable plastic bottle.


If the plastic waste found on the beaches was somehow the result of Coca-Cola's factory runoff this headline could be valid, however all it proves is that Coca-Cola products are the most likely to be identifiable when found washed up on a beach."	exploration

Nobody else has worn the crown as long as her in the entire history of her nation. Who's her peer? who's her equal? who's someone who can truly know what it's like to live as the embodimient and the personification of an institution, of a nation, for nearly 70 years??? who really understands what it's like to be Queen Elizabeth? the only one who could just died. 

I know it's weird to feel sympathy for a literal queen, but come on, she's human too. She's the last connection to history for our generation, actually for 2-3 generations. She's the only person alive who worked with WINSTON CHURCHILL (I mean, there must surely be some young people back then, involved in minor roles of the government, who are still alive, but when it comes to big names, to decisive rulers or head of states, she's the only one alive to have worked with the man that defeated Hitler).

Though i have to be critical at the set goal. A goal of making all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable can be abused. Technically almost all plastics are recyclable, therefore it would meet such a requirement. The goal is to **ensure** that the packaging is indeed recycled, reused or composted, which is much harder. 

I have worked with many packaging suppliers, they all try this trick of marketing their packaging as recyclable. Which is technically true, but in practice 0% of that packaging would be recycled as there was no return stream set up or no recyclers accepting that material."	evaluation

I always thought that it was unfair having to work  5 days a week and only getting only two days to rest. Who came up with the idea anyway? Friday translated to German is Freitag which pretty much means free day. A split of 4:3 looks so much better than 5:2. You look at the number 5 and you realize I work more than the double the amount of days compared to the 2 days on the weekend. I seriously hope this gets changed some day. It's such a chore having to get up early when it's still dark and then come home when it's getting dark. It's such a depressing situation in my life. Everyday I wish a goddamn meteorite would hit me and end my life with a bang.	"In terms of ""who came up with this idea"" you are looking at that backwards.

> Iran has issued an arrest warrant and asked Interpol for help in detaining US President Donald Trump and dozens of others it believes carried out the drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad. Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said on Monday that Trump, along with more than 30 others Iran accuses of involvement in the January 3 attack that killed General Qassem Soleimani, face &quot;Murder and terrorism charges&quot;, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.

> Alqasimehr was also quoted as saying Iran had requested a &quot;Red notice&quot; be put out for Trump and the others, the highest-level notice issued by Interpol, requesting that seeks the location and arrest of the individual named.

> It is unlikely Interpol would grant Iran&#039;s request as its guideline for notices forbids it from &quot;Undertaking any intervention or activities of a political&quot; nature.

Trump is guilty as sin on this but it’s laughable Iran gets Interpol on this considering their response was to gun down a commercial jet “by accident”. This jet was transporting Canadians, Americans, and Iranians.

They may not forget solemeni, but as a Canadian I won’t forget the jet they shot down with our people in it then shrug it off and sweep it under the rug.

Now we get this bombshell. Not only were they processing data from facebook they shouldn't have they where also ratfucking in 200 different countries. And their CEO was caught on tape admitting to all this shit! Bribery, entrapment, defamation. 


*And these guys worked for the Trump Campaign* 


Tomorrow we should hear some more of what these guys did with the Trump campaign, as well as a potential raid on their offices. These guys are absolutely fucked and the ramifications could ripple on for months as the British investigators likely coordinate with the FBI and other agencies around the globe to round up these scumbags.

Please remember this, everything you normally hear about Bangladesh in the international media is sugarcoated. Bangladesh is a democratic country for show only. Freedom of speech is suppressed, the government is totalitarian, and they actively target, abduct, or beat up dissenters. The prime minister might be considered to be some icon for feminism, humanity, whatever by ousiders but we absolutely hate all ministers (including the prime minister) bar some. We are regularly threatened by BCL (the student political body), they've committed countless atrocities. You might hear about Bangladesh doing well economically but what good is that when you can't even be safe? Minorities like the indigenous people, refugees, Hindus and Christians are brutally discriminated. The military has no accountability, they can do whatever they want. It can be called an absolute shithole since you have no say, and human rights are breached regularly. The worst thing is that since corruption is so rampant, there's hardly anything we can do. And if we do try, they accuse us of being against the nation or the freedom fighters, they just manipulate patriotic sentiments. Even as we speak, the government is suing and arresting people who posted videos and pictures on social media.

They mobs rushed gun wielding police forces while brandishing weapons. Thats pretty much daring the police forces to shoot them.

That being said, I am not here siding with the hk police. I feel bad for hk since they are under China's rule and wants their own voice. But, why the fuck is everyone pitying the 16 year old by saying ""oh he is fighting for his freedom and got shot"". That poor 16 year old was literally hitting police with a baton... Like name me a country where you can hit a policeman, who is holding a revolver, with a baton, and expect nothing to happen.

There have been tons of violence on both sides and it has been slowly escalating with the hk protesters thinking that an escalation in violence and destruction would bring the world's spotlight and change china's attitude. That thought seems so preposterous its actually laughable. China would never allow such a precedent of giving in to violent protests to be set. The only way for China to give in is if negotiations happened under the table, away from spotlight.

Gonna take the time to refute a common misunderstanding that it is only the young people who support the protests. A lot of the older people are helping with the behind the scenes stuff such as buying the riot gear and supplies, providing rides to protesters because the metro is usually shut down at a protest, and providing various other kinds of support.
