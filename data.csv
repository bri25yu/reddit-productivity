0	k4qide	geax3ef	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"“I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community”

How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?"	"> fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights

Worse - ~~he sued, and won, a defamation lawsuit 5 years ago~~ for $7,500 because someone called him gay.

EDIT: my Hungarian is terrible and the tweet I read was incorrect. This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.

He's now #1 on [gayhomophobe.com](https://gayhomophobe.com/)

*According to the first-instance verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Klára Ungár will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*

*Klára Ungár, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted Máté Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*

*Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that Máté Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*"	exploration

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views."	exploration

My only hope is that this dissent is strong enough to bring an end to this horrible regime. Warmongering tyrants need to meet the fate that they deserve to deter any future incursions. Ultimately, I will not be upset if Putin is found hanging from a streetlight by the end of this war.	evaluation

We know. At some point, everyone has thought about it. Human nature implies greed and corruption. This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption. I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings. So I'll just skip to the point.

Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.

Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..

Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.

We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,

Loved and were loved, and now we lie 

In Flanders fields.

The torch; be yours to hold it high!

He's never had to fight hard for anything in his life since his dad gave him all the money he started with. I bet the most amount of actual hard work Trump has ever done was when he shoves his tiny little nipple-dick in his disgusted wife for about 3 pumps before he gives up and falls off her like the disgusting fat slob that he is. 

My point is, Trump doesn't care about anyone but himself and doesn't even understand what the word sacrifice means since everything he's ever had was either handed to him, or he cheated, lied and stole to get it. 

Maybe people are being critical of him not showing up to the cemetery, but he probably did all those dead soldiers a favour by not walking across their graves. 

Those cemeteries in France are filled with brave, honourable men who are loved and adored. Four things Trump's never been by anyone worth even the salt of the earth. "	exploration

We need to come together with a unified voice to demand real and tangible change for the police. 

We must:

1) Demand civilian Oversight for all police actions

2) Create Equality before the law for police and citizens

3) Encourage De-Escalation tactics to save the lives of the people they should be serving

4) Incentivize Reporting because the police need to have a duty to the public

5) Mandate Transparency because when the rules are broken we need to know about it to hold them responsible

&#x200B;

With these 5 points we can create a nation where the police serve the people.

Adrian Zenz.  
  
Can’t speak or read Chinese but is the leading expert in “Uighur concentration camps”, his other hobbies include being a religious nutbag you literally believes he is on a mission directly from God to defeat Beijing, and he has written a book titled “Worthy to Escape: Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation” about how the fall of capitalism and abortion will bring the anti-Christ to earth.  
  
He’s also a leading figure in the “victims against communism memorial foundation”.. so I’m sure he’s not biased against China whatsoever... 
  
Can’t believe people just eat up all this propaganda about muslims being genocided and the existence of concentration camps. It ALL comes from this one crazy religious guy.  
  
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/15/asia/united-nations-letter-xinjiang-intl-hnk/index.html  
  
Westerners come off as so fucking stupid when articles like this say that 37 Muslim countries have sent envoys to China to inspect the camps personally and have all condoned and declared that no human rights violations are happening and the Muslim’s in the camps are being treated equally and fairly, yet apparently *that’s* the propaganda?
  
Americans need to shut the fuck up. They don’t care about muslims. They’ve spent the last few decades invading the middle-east and slaughtering millions of innocent muslims, destabilising and toppling entire countries and bringing rise to terrorist groups like ISIS. But a little bit of propaganda in their news telling them “cHiNa Is KiLlInG mUsLiMs!” and suddenly they’re all pro-Muslim and think China needs to be invaded to save the muslims?  
  
Don’t make me laugh. America is just trying to manufacture consent to start a war. They’re desperate to point fingers at anything but the fact their country is burning to the ground because of administration inaction and racial inequality."	exploration

What we'll get: Overwatch removed from Europe."	"I’m really curious about how this could affect overwatch in different ways. I choose not to buy loot boxes, so from my selfish perspective, I appreciate all the people buying them and paying for all the updates and events that I get for free. 

But at the same time, if there are kids out there stealing money from their parents to buy loot boxes, then that means I am profiting off of that. 

If they changed to direct purchase of in game items, they no doubt would make less money, but I wonder if maybe more people would take part in the micro transactions. Would they still make enough to fully support the game at the level they do currently?

I also wonder how a season pass model would work. I would be perfectly fine with a $20 annual pass, but how many others would? 

My unfortunate assumption is that the majority of players benefit most from the current system at the expense of those minority “whales” and those who spend an irresponsible amount on loot boxes. 

So the question is, if loot boxes are removed, what could possibly take their place that would provide Blizzard with enough post-sale revenue to maintain overwatch at the current level?

The minister of Justice wants to ban in-game purchases, if you don't know exactly what it will contain. ""Combining gambling and gaming, especially at a young age, is dangerous for the mental health of the child.

The commotion started last week with the new game Star Wars: Battlefront in the the game you could buy so called ""loot boxes"", virtual boxes which could contain advantages for the game. You don't know however what it contains beforehand.

""The combination of money and addiction is gambling"", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.

Geens now wants to prevent that these kinds of functions will be in any games going forward. ""But that takes time, because we'll have to make a proposal to the EU. We will definitely try to ban it.""

Now, I am not deleting my facebook account. Facebook is a tool that I like.

I am on my alternate account, and the reason is, I am kind of ""in industry"". I work with clients who use facebook and other tools to advertise.

It's important to note that this plugin doesn't really solve the whole ""Cambridge Analytica"" thing. That cat is already out of the bag. That data is out there. There was a great article on the atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/arch that kind of explained what happened there. Essentially, back in the the early facebook days, they were trying to establish an ecosystem of apps. These were things like iq tests,games, etc, but also included things like registering for a third party website. When you installed one of those apps, you gave facebook permission to give that 3rd party your information. Once it was given, there is no way to get it back.That was things like your school, your contact information and your friends. When facebook transitioned to mobile first, that ""installing apps"" thing kind of stopped. The extension does nothing to solve this problem.

Now, there is another dimension, which is facebook tracking on pages that aren't facebook. This used to be commonly done with ""share on facebook buttons"". Now, it's a lot less transparent. It is very commonly set up so that when you visit a site, facebook knows. Then, someone can target you with an ad on facebook based on that information. For example, you go to a tee-shirt store. You don't buy the tee shirt. And, then you go on facebook and see an ad for that teeshirt. I believe this is what the plugin is designed to solve.

Another thing that facebook does is it takes lists from other people. You load the lists in, and then facebook can do a few things. It can serve ads to those people. But, it can also find people who are similar to those people. And then it can serve ads based on either of those. So in the t-shirt example, if someone visits the store and makes a purchase. You can take a list of all those people, load it into facebook and find other people who look similar. Then, serve ads to those people. This extension does nothing to fix this. 

Most of the actual advertising that is done with facebook is actually on one of their properties (basically instagram and facebook). I believe that facebook has some ability to serve ads off facebook, but I have actually heard very little about it. Theoretically, this extension would help, but Google really dominates that market. So, this would be a drop in the bucket.

232	87icwb	dwd0ql2	Mozilla launches 'Facebook Container' extension for its Firefox browser that isolates the Facebook identity of users from rest of their web activity	Mozilla launches 'Facebook Container' extension for its Firefox browser that isolates the Facebook identity of users from rest of their web activity	"Highlights:

>This extension helps you control more of your web activity from Facebook by isolating your identity into a separate container. This makes it harder for Facebook to track your activity on other websites via third-party cookies.

>Mozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We only know the number of times the extension is installed or removed.

>If you use your Facebook credentials to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials, it may not work properly and you may not be able to login. Also, because you’re logged into Facebook in the container tab, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook container tab will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity. So it may look different than what you are used to seeing.

>What does Facebook Container NOT protect against?^1

>It is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.

So someone extremely close to Epstein, and has been accused by many people of procuring and trafficking children for him is going to come out and say that one of the trafficked girls is lying about who she was forced to have sex with. 

So is she planning on coming out and saying she setup the rapes and so knows exactly who was raping the kids? Is she planning on saying she had absolutely nothing to do with the rapes and didn't know any of it was happening BUT she also knows Prince Pedo didn't do any of it?

I hate that this is happening. I have a lot of Ukrainian friends and it’s truly awful to see how their families are suffering right now. We all are very close and almost everyone has a friend, relative or someone they know on the other end and we can’t comprehend why it’s happening.

It is so heartbreaking to see young soldiers to go to war that they don’t want to fight just because of our crazy president. The situation is really complicated because they do it out of fear for their families and their lives.

I’m almost crying while reading the support words that you guys write, especially after headings that I’ve seen recently “I hate Putin, I hate Russia”. Russia is not Putin, it’s much more than that. Putin is a fucking narcissist and psycho, one of the worst things that ever happened to Russia…

We have a great generation of empathetic, intelligent and friendly people and I believe that we will be able to bring a bright future in which Russia will not be seen as a constant aggressor…

Now for the facts and figures:

Trump owe a 30% stake in a real estate asset that is partially financed by Bank of China. 

This is **extremely** common in ANY large scale financing. Either the lead bank(s) lends the money, and then syndicates the loan out to dozens of banks, or a club of banks get together at the beginning and finance it. 

Trump does NOT owe Bank of China 30% of $950m. That would be if he borrowed directly from them. He has a partial stake in an asset that has a $950m loan on it. That’s very different. If you owned shares in Tesla, even as a tiny holder, would you say you owe money to Tesla’s creditors?

"My country also had a peaceful transition of power, granted it was a result of an anti-socialist revolution, but I still believe the world could also learn a thing or two from it:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet\_Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution)

Please, I urge you not to fall into the fake belief that socialism is the answer to your problems. The generation of my parents literally had to bleed on the streets to get our generation rid of socialism and ensure a future for us. We all thank them for their sacrifice every single day. 

I just returned from an excursion to Devin Castle in Slovakia, which is at the border between former Czechoslovakia and Austria. It shows all the people who tried to escape socialism while risking their lives, only to be torn apart alive by dogs, or shot to pieces by border guards (if they got lucky). Yet people still kept risking being torn apart by dogs just to escape socialism, they kept thinking of innovative ways to escape (like home-made diving suits which caused the to drown, or home-made rogallos which caused them to be shot to death before their dead bodies even reached the Austrian side of the river). 

The rise of the radical right in the US makes me sick as half of my family suffered immensely in camps the last time it happened in our part of Europe. And the rise of the radical left makes me equally sick as socialists did more harm to us than the nazis ever could. Please, I beg you, don't fall into this trap. My chess coach always said ""A smart man learns from his mistakes, a smarter man learns from mistakes of others"". Please learn from our mistakes, the entire world will benefit from that. Please listen to people who experienced what you wish for. We are not idiots, we are people just like you and we have experienced the thing you are wishing for right now.

1. This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address.
2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving).
3. From the paper itself: ""We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment."" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already.
4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.

Source - PhD in Microbiology and Immunology"	"I do agree that the concept and implementation of oncolytic viruses are not new (clinical trials have started years ago around world), however I do disagree with one point, being that: 

>T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors

and 

>Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments.

[Regulatory T-cells can infiltrate tumors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5041022/) (so not all T-cells are bad at getting into tumors). T-regs maintain our immune system's sense of 'self' and prevents pathological self-reactivity (i.e. autoimmune diseases). However, when recruited by cancerous growths, tumors hijack this feature (akin to stealing the body's sense of 'self' and camouflaging as 'self' cells). The reason why this paper's approach is effective because they are able to simultaneously inhibit tumor infiltrated T-regs (i.e. getting rid of the 'self' signal) and activate effector T-cell function (immune system soldiers). They force tumor-associated T-regs to express a receptor, inject the antibody to said receptor so they aggregate at the tumor site. Effector T-cells nearby are then stimulated by antibodies to OX40 and initiates the rest of the immune response. 

I do agree that its major limitation is the direct injection aspect (which they acknowledged right out in the discussion) but it is a truly elegant system they've set up. "	exploration

For context, from what small amount I know of the Choctaw's struggles, their relocation through the Trail of Tears happened during 1830-33 (broad dates) while our famine was approximately during 1845-49. The Choctaw tribe had experienced thousands of deaths during relocation and were about as destitute as one could imagine. I think that makes the donation all the more powerful. These people had nothing except for heartbreak and betrayal and when the plight of others reached their settlements they rallied together to give almost everything they had. All this born out of the understanding of pain the Irish were suffering and not wishing to see another race of people face those same torments. 

I'm not one for big internet posts or to get too emotional about this sort of stuff, but there's a special place in my heart for the Choctaw tribe and other Native Americans. I think it's one of the purest examples of the kindness and solidarity of people, something the modern world has forgotten a bit too often."	I completely agree.

I've seen comment that we are ignorant and racist to lump all Native Americans into the same group. And that we are short sighted to assume Choctaw = Najavo. Most people here know that these are different peoples, separated by hundreds of miles within the continent that is North America. But the one thing we all have in common (Ireland, Najavo, Choctaw, all native Americans) is that we have all suffered greatly from colonialism, we've all had out land taken from us, we've all been forced to relocate (Trail of Tears, To Hell or to Connaught), we've all been brutalised and murdered by a larger power. Irish people sympathise with that, and this is a case of paying it forward, not paying it back.

We will gladly never settle this debt with Choctaw, and I imagine anytime the Irish learn of an indigenous people suffering, we'll be there to give a helping hand."	A lot of Irish people feel the same about Palestine especially in the West. Last time I was in Connemara I noticed a few free Palestine flags and banner around the place. We do have a talent for noticing the messed up that goes on around the world. However we’re pretty much America’s younger cousin at this point so that also says something.	exploration

at the Vatican:

>**Italian Cardinal**: Cardinals, bishops, and priests, an American priest by the name of-a Maxi has brought to our attention the most troubling of news. All over his-a country there are reports of children being molested by men of the Church.

>**Priest Maxi**: That's right-wait. What?

Others don't want to make any changes to their lives like eating less meat, using less plastic, etc. Some are stupid and think they know better than doctors or scientists. A few don't care at all. There are also those that make money off of the status quo, so don't want to support what could affect their bottom line.

There’s this story that some Church goers need to hear... 

A man got stranded in a flood and as the flood waters rises he climbed to the top of his house. 

A man in a raft came by and offered to rescue him. 

“Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the raft went on. 

Then a boat came by and offered to save him. 


“Don’t worry! God will save me!” He said. So the boat went on. Flood waters continued to rise and a helicopter came by and offered to save him. He gave the same excuse that God would save him. Helicopter went on and eventually the flood waters rose higher and he drowned. 

He got to heaven and asked God “Why didn’t you save me? I believed in you trusted that you would.” 

Now all you smart people out there already figured out the ending to this. 

And God said “I tried, I sent a raft, a boat, and a helicopter to save you but you turned them all down.”

I keep hearing stories about people who say Christians shouldn’t be afraid because God will protect us... that’s not how this works. All churches should close. They shouldn’t be exempt from this. Use common sense people. If you believe in God then you should believe God sent experts and scientists to give you the proper advice on how to avoid this."	evaluation

I know Reddit loves to hate big corporations especially Coca-Cola and has a massive disdain for plastic products, but to see this article with this source of data on the front page once again is really discouraging and really highlights the fact that there are many users who do not read what they upvote.


This article claims that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter**. This is a pretty bold claim, so let's see how they determined that fact:


The article cites a yearly study performed once again in which a supposidly accurate determination of plastic polluters is identified by using plastic bottles that have washed up on beaches. 


This year's study was performed by collecting 346,494 plastic bottles from beaches. Among those, 218,291 of them were able to be identified by brand. Of those identifiable bottles Coca-Cola brand products made up 13,843 of the bottles found on the beach. 

Although many of these smaller numbers are cleverly danced-around or completely omitted in the data source, this comes out to be a total of **4% of the total bottles collected were identified as belonging to Coca-Cola brand products.**


4% may not seem like a lot to begin with, but let's also consider a few other factors: Anyone who has ever been to a store in the past 10 years can tell you with certainty that Coca-Cola brand does a very good job of trademarking their product. Every Coca-Cola brand drink (including their teas, sports drinks, juices, and bottled water) has a unique style plastic bottle, and this is reflected across all of their sizes from 12 oz, to 24 oz, to 2 l bottles. This plastic bottle design makes their product visually different from the competitors' bottles who mostly use the same generic shape. When exposed to saltwater and constant sunlight many plastic bottles fade, fall apart, lose their labels, or the labels fade to clear. Because the bottles are discarded, bottle caps with brands on them are often missing as well. Those that have bottle caps are also usually faded and brand stamps worn away. 


Despite the harsh weathering there is one persistent detail among the bottles that makes them uniquely and easily identifiable and that is **the shape of the plastic bottle itself**. and as we know Coca-Cola is one of the few brands that has a unique easily identifiable plastic bottle shape. What this means in the context of the study is that every single Coca-Cola product bottle from the past decade was easily identified by their bottle shape, however other leading competitor brands which do not feature a unique bottle shape relied entirely on the label print for identification. this means that 100% of the Coca-Cola products found on the beach were correctly identified as Coca-Cola brand products, however it's very likely that only a small percentage of waste from other brand products were able to be identified due to weathering.


So not only are the results fairly insignificant at only 4%, but they are also extremely biased and unreliable.


Using this data the study claimed that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluting brand**. Ignoring the flawed data for a moment let's take a look at what this claim means in regards to this particular study with an analogy:


*Imagine you're walking into work one morning and you notice a large pile of cigarette butts lying on the ground around the smoker's pole in the parking lot. Being the good samaritan that you are you pick up the trash. You count that you've picked up 100 cigarette butts. Out of those cigarette butts 37 of them are just plain orange or white design with no identifiable information. However, 63 of them have a brand name or logo printed on them. There's a very large variety of brands, many of which you've never even heard of, however 4 out of the 100 are Marlboro. With all the different brands mixed in Marlboro makes up the largest number of the identifiable cigarette butts.* **Using this information you determine that Marlboro cigarette company must be the number one litter producer in the world.**

______

While the results of the study are interesting and important, they do not and never have supported the claim that Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter. Using the data in this way only proves one or more of the following points:

1) Coca-Cola produces the most popular brands of bottled products.

2) Coca-Cola product consumers litter more often than consumers of other products.

3) Coca-Cola brand products have the most easily identifiable plastic bottle.


If the plastic waste found on the beaches was somehow the result of Coca-Cola's factory runoff this headline could be valid, however all it proves is that Coca-Cola products are the most likely to be identifiable when found washed up on a beach."	exploration

Nobody else has worn the crown as long as her in the entire history of her nation. Who's her peer? who's her equal? who's someone who can truly know what it's like to live as the embodimient and the personification of an institution, of a nation, for nearly 70 years??? who really understands what it's like to be Queen Elizabeth? the only one who could just died. 

I know it's weird to feel sympathy for a literal queen, but come on, she's human too. She's the last connection to history for our generation, actually for 2-3 generations. She's the only person alive who worked with WINSTON CHURCHILL (I mean, there must surely be some young people back then, involved in minor roles of the government, who are still alive, but when it comes to big names, to decisive rulers or head of states, she's the only one alive to have worked with the man that defeated Hitler).

They started hiring a small sustainability team that made quite some local impact.

Though i have to be critical at the set goal. A goal of making all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable can be abused. Technically almost all plastics are recyclable, therefore it would meet such a requirement. The goal is to **ensure** that the packaging is indeed recycled, reused or composted, which is much harder. 

I have worked with many packaging suppliers, they all try this trick of marketing their packaging as recyclable. Which is technically true, but in practice 0% of that packaging would be recycled as there was no return stream set up or no recyclers accepting that material."	evaluation

Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said on Monday that Trump, along with more than 30 others Iran accuses of involvement in the January 3 attack that killed General Qassem Soleimani, face &quot;Murder and terrorism charges&quot;, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.

> Alqasimehr was also quoted as saying Iran had requested a &quot;Red notice&quot; be put out for Trump and the others, the highest-level notice issued by Interpol, requesting that seeks the location and arrest of the individual named.

> It is unlikely Interpol would grant Iran&#039;s request as its guideline for notices forbids it from &quot;Undertaking any intervention or activities of a political&quot; nature.

If someone was going to kill him, I would think it would likely be some new guy who voluntarily (as much as one can volunteer) signed up to be on his personal staff.

With that said, if (when?) someone does finally do something about him, I sincerely hope it is quick. Putin has already shown he is a raging paranoid lunatic with no regard for human life. I can't even imagine what he might do if he is poisoned with something slow acting and he knows he is going to die. I don't think it would be a stretch to think he would launch every nuclear missile just out of spite (""if I'm going to die, so is the rest of the world"" type mentality)."	"> Objectively, doesn't it seem illogical to replace 1000 people who, I would assume thus far have been loyal to him, with 1000 new people who he probably has little direct experience with?

The idea is that foreign powers may have worked to get an agent in the people who are close to him.  One person in that thousand might've been turned and it's very hard to weed that person out.  By doing a swap with a new 1000 people who have probably been watched and vetted for some time but who are very unlikely to have been approached by foreign powers (why would they?) there is a potential benefit."	evaluation

The overwhelming majority of people who own guns legally  are just everyday folks who enjoy a day out in the woods or at a range having fun with their friends and family, testing there skill and enjoying the day. What they are NOT, are creepy weirdos sitting in a dark room plotting to commit crime. The only time people hear about these guns is when some fruitloop with mental health issues or gangster commits some unspeakable crime. Everyday thousands of gun owners go out and enjoy themselves without so much as a bother to anyone else. MILLIONS of firearms owners here in Canada go about their days without most people never even knowing they own guns. Legal gun owners, regardless of what type of guns they own, are not a problem here in Canada. Why waste time with irrelevant laws that mean nothing to criminals?	evaluation

**To any Republican & Trump lover out there:** I don't think you understand how big this is. This isn't only about Trump, get this into your republican heads. This will affect millions of people around the globe. This will affect laws and regulations because of shady corporations like Cambride Analytica and Facebook. This will has its effect on a global level we've never seen before, this is such a shady occuring that many people believed it would never exist or could have dreamed of. We are at the mainstream media now, this will only get bigger and bigger. Nevertheless this is also going to have an impact on ongoing Mueller case. Wake up and stop spamming me with non-sense. Btw BUT HER EMAILS!!! Amirite?﻿"	I'm glad the UK are involved in investigating this one as well. There are too many people in power in the US who want to hinder investigations.	exploration

PolyU has just fallen into the hands of HKPF earlier today and who knows what will happen to our friends there, some of us are already being transported to China with the help of MTR earlier this week. So, please don't think we've won just because of this law, we have a long way to go.

Edit: You can help us by spreading the message that this fight is far from over, boycott Chinese products as much as you can (although it’s easier said than done), encourage the media to monitor the situation in HK and have them keep an eye of the brutality of HKPF. If you do have time and money, come to Hong Kong and record what you see, we have much less Chinese visiting us now so there will be a lot more room for you to explore and hotel prices are a lot lower now. Of course, the best thing you can do is to join the protests and gatherings, they should be safe as long as the Police don’t swoop in and screw everything up, but your safety is the top priority. Anyway, thank you all for your support, without you we wouldn’t have come this far.

They can evacuate and appear to look weak on the global stage

Or they can retaliate which I consider the wildcard response.

When the virus first started spreading, many ridiculed the government for a lousy response.  Not doing enough, should’ve completely shut the gates, etc.  A bunch of knee-jerk responses.

Then once Shincheonji happened, they again blamed the government.  Petition to impeach the president received much support.

Again, not doing enough, should forcibly quarantine whole cities (who cares we aren’t China), etc.

A few more weeks down the road, looks like we might be the only country doing shit the right way.

1)  Response in accordance to threat level.  Steadily escalate as virus gets worse.

2)  Massive spending of tax money.  Announce early on government will cover all. COVID related healthcare cases.

3) Easy testing.

Please remember this, everything you normally hear about Bangladesh in the international media is sugarcoated. Bangladesh is a democratic country for show only. Freedom of speech is suppressed, the government is totalitarian, and they actively target, abduct, or beat up dissenters. The prime minister might be considered to be some icon for feminism, humanity, whatever by ousiders but we absolutely hate all ministers (including the prime minister) bar some. We are regularly threatened by BCL (the student political body), they've committed countless atrocities. You might hear about Bangladesh doing well economically but what good is that when you can't even be safe? Minorities like the indigenous people, refugees, Hindus and Christians are brutally discriminated. The military has no accountability, they can do whatever they want. It can be called an absolute shithole since you have no say, and human rights are breached regularly. The worst thing is that since corruption is so rampant, there's hardly anything we can do. And if we do try, they accuse us of being against the nation or the freedom fighters, they just manipulate patriotic sentiments. Even as we speak, the government is suing and arresting people who posted videos and pictures on social media. They're saying that we are spreading misinformation and absolutely nothing happened today. It's a total shitshow.	evaluation

The Border Guard Bangladesh faction which is independent of the Bangladesh Army and government has also declined helping the students because internally most of the high commanders are pro government.

The Parliament of 300 seats are all occupied by pro Government allies as the opposition boycotted the General National Elections and thus no one will speak against this in the Parliament as well. The Courts of Bangladesh are also fully pro Government as the recent Chief Justice and important post holders have pre dominantly supported the Government.

The Police is protecting government goons and an informal curfew is being observed with Bangladesh AwamiLeague goons setting up 'points' at places in Dhaka and targeting student irrespective of the fact whether they are protesting or not. No one is getting spared. We have no one to talk to. The people are left alone by all the major bodies of Bangladesh.

Recieving payment from a foreign country to attempt to overthrow one's own government is treason.

The people actually doing the work and uncovering it have probably been shouting it to their superiors, who are shouting it to theirs, who are trying to tell those who can do something about it and that's where it falls on deaf ears. It isn't the failing of the intelligence community, it's the failing of either those who were put in charge by the current administration or the administration itself.	evaluation

They mobs rushed gun wielding police forces while brandishing weapons. Thats pretty much daring the police forces to shoot them.

That being said, I am not here siding with the hk police. I feel bad for hk since they are under China's rule and wants their own voice. But, why the fuck is everyone pitying the 16 year old by saying ""oh he is fighting for his freedom and got shot"". That poor 16 year old was literally hitting police with a baton... Like name me a country where you can hit a policeman, who is holding a revolver, with a baton, and expect nothing to happen.

There have been tons of violence on both sides and it has been slowly escalating with the hk protesters thinking that an escalation in violence and destruction would bring the world's spotlight and change china's attitude. That thought seems so preposterous its actually laughable. China would never allow such a precedent of giving in to violent protests to be set. The only way for China to give in is if negotiations happened under the table, away from spotlight.

Gonna take the time to refute a common misunderstanding that it is only the young people who support the protests. A lot of the older people are helping with the behind the scenes stuff such as buying the riot gear and supplies, providing rides to protesters because the metro is usually shut down at a protest, and providing various other kinds of support.
