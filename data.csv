1	k4qide	geadsg3	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"“I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community”

How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?"
2	k4qide	geabksk	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"If they had said ""It was an orgy that involved sexual acts between 7 men"" I would have been like ""WHOA! The anti-gay guy, 7 dudes? That's a lot!!"" 

But it's 25. 25 men. A 25 man orgy. That's not an orgy, that's Carnival level.

(A note. Being gay, totally awesome and fine. So are orgies, straight or gay. But the thick layer of goddamn hypocrisy covering the whole thing is indefensible and unforgivable.)"

""I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community,"" he added.”

So “strictly personal” for him but not any other person that is LGBTQ.  Got it. 

“Oh and please don’t tell the people back home I’m a fucking hypocrite”."
6	k4qide	gea94mz	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	25 men is a lot of men for a homophobe
7	k4qide	gedco59	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	As a Hungarian, I am totally ashamed of what our government does. What they advocate in the country is ridiculous (forcing christianity insanely so as anti-lmbtq) and whatever they do their reason is either “George Soros” or “Brussels” or “Migrants”. Such a shameful country with even more sad acts. Now clearly several times the government (Fidesz) was busted with scandals such as one of a Hungarian city’s major got caught having an orgy with a bunch of cocaine and hookers on a yacht which was presumably bought and maintained by the taxpayers money or the pedophile case which was conducted by another diplomat related to the government and now this idiot...
8	k4qide	geahvvg	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	Not very surprising. If you are that focused on other people’s sexual preferences, it is a dead giveaway that you are either trying to control your own urges, a complete idiot, or, as is most often the case, both.
9	k4qide	geadcag	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"> Szájer, who fronted Fidesz in the European Parliament, helped rewrite Hungary's constitution to ""protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman,""

Because of course, it's not enough for themselves to be in the closet, they need everyone else with them and if they won't hide who they are then they must be shamed.

Fuck this guy.

100% of voting Republicans voted no on both articles. 99% of Democrats voted yes on both articles. Only one independent representative *existed*.

By contrast, the nay [votes on Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) were split 50/50. And 15 out of 100 votes across the [Republican vote on Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton) were nay.

My only hope is that this dissent is strong enough to bring an end to this horrible regime. Warmongering tyrants need to meet the fate that they deserve to deter any future incursions.

I do not believe that Russia was the first to enter the border of Ukraine. Putin would not have made such a stupid decision. I'm sorry, of course, but it seems to me that the European Union and America are deliberately provoking Russia to such actions in order to eventually capture us”

How can you believe that after The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation announced that they will detain ""participants of unauthorized actions in the regions"" if they go to rallies against the war with Ukraine

I am from Russia, but I have Ukrainian roots. I am terrified. Russia has long been in the ass, everything is becoming more expensive. Now it will get even worse.

If earlier I went to a rally, then later, after the birth of a child, I will not go. If they put me in jail, who will take care of him? Matvienko calls those who are against the war terrorists.

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views."

"To all the people here saying ""What does it matter?"" and anything of the like: 

We know. At some point, everyone has thought about it. Human nature implies greed and corruption. This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption. I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings. So I'll just skip to the point.

Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.

Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..

Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.

Or don't. It's your choice."

This type of corruption has always been practically a fact, but having actual data to back this up is incredible.

"From the ""About the Panama Papers"" section on the site, in case you want a quick summary: ""Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.

In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.

The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes."""

"Good. Sydney absolutely relies on the fireworks as it's main tourist draw, not just for the fireworks themselves but to showcase the city globally for other visitors.

People book up years in advance, what are you going to tell those tourists? There is no link between the fireworks and bushfires, and the smoke from the fireworks is tiny compared to even a small bushfire.

Cancelling the fireworks would be tantamount NSW shooting itself in the foot. Tourism is a vital segment of the economy, visitor numbers will be depressed enough already, without effectively covering the shop window.

The environment is important, global warming is real and needs broad, effective action. Bushfires are a tragedy and the Federal government's response is a joke. However, cancelling the fireworks is a stupid, self-defeating idea"

"I am brand new to Reddit, and the vitriolic responses to my first post left the clear impression that political machinery tries to manipulate this medium. I know nothing about this ‘Net Neutrality’ issue, but fortunately my daughter does. She agrees that rolling back current protections will hurt Internet freedom.

The attacks on Trump, etc., intended to garner support made me suspicious, but my daughter, who is far from some political hack, convinced me that we need to stop the FCC in this case."

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which determines what species are endangered, breaks down into the following categories, in increasing order of concern:

(1) Near Threatened

(2) Vulnerable

(3) Endangered

(4) Critically Endangered

(5) Extinct in the Wild

(6) Extinct

The Giraffe is currently at rank 2 ""vulnerable"" which the IUCN defines as ""likely to become endangered unless the circumstances that are threatening its survival and reproduction change.""  

I would say that this is a pretty big ""no shit"" as this label should apply to basically every animal unless humans do something to combat climate change. This still is a very far cry from ""facing extinction"" which in miy mind implies connection to critically endangered animals such as Rhinos or or animals which are extinct in the wild such as the South China Tiger.

Look through it and pick out certain sentences (or sentence fragments), ones unlikely to be found anywhere but the book you need.  Search Google for those sentences using double quotes.

I remember finding not only entire PDFs of the books I needed, but also chapter by chapter scans uploaded to random institutions by professors who said “fuck the publishers.”

Another one is to use filetype:PDF or filetype:torrent qualifiers, though I don’t know if that works anymore."

I went to a Barnes & Noble, and they said they could order it for $45...then asked me if I was a teacher.  When I said I wasn't, I was told the price was $200.

I got pretty angry, and decided that if the publishers and the campus book store were happy robbing me, then I would be okay doing the same.

I bought the book, scanned it into a PDF, and then returned in a couple of days, so I got all my money back for the book, and a few friends got free PDFs of a $200 textbook.

Since then, I've only seen more and more proof that what I did was fully justified."

Even though I took a class that was nearly an exact replica of this one back when I was in Community College. The only difference? The CC Prof gave us the book in pdf for free if we read his syllabus all the way. 

UW's choice of book? Fucking Cengage and their access codes. I have to pay to do homework. Usually if you need a code, you're going to be doing homework on that platform. Access codes are a scam and promotes lazy grading and cut/paste classroom formats. Every single class I've taken that used Cengage or Pearson (mostly Math), the grading style was exactly the same, do the homework that is available on the website.

(NEWSFLASH: This promotes cheating since everyone knows what google search does)

These homework assignments were always due the morning of class or the following night usually ranging 20 to 40 problems. The few classes that didn't use an access code had the most active professors I've ever had. My Diff EQ class was the best and hardest time of my life because the professor made our homework and tests from scratch but also made sure the topic was understood.

tldr: Fuck Access Codes.

Edit: I almost forgot. Fuck Cengage too!"

I am from Hong Kong, so we are not under the censorship of CCP (yet) and we have some accesses to what the mainland China people shared on the social media, and we are quite concerned on the situation as Hong Kong was hit badly by the SARS 17 years ago

The confirmed cases released by CCP gov is some 800 infected now, but some Wuhan residents said there were at least 10,000+ cases and the hospitals are flooded with patients

[1st Footage](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220015683964026880) : The narrator said : ""I'm showing you the real situation in hospital here (showing the quarantine tents all around), If your family have children and could stay at home, just stay, don't go out! The  gravity of situation here is unimaginable.....this is what is actually happening inside the hospital, just like a bio hazard"" and he was coughing heavily in the end......

[3rd footage](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220358585713999874)

&#x200B;

[There is a footage](https://youtu.be/oY64klryE9E) of medical staff facing mental breakdown with the overwhelming situation

He was saying : There are patients lying all over the floor of the hospital! We worked for 4 shift per day! Are you not going to let us live?! I can't do this more..... get them (the patients) out! get them out! I can't do this anymore! 

&#x200B;

[There are footages](https://www.facebook.com/100000150464406/posts/3202562866425364/) of people suddenly collapsing in public areas and medical staff went to handle the situation

The whole city of Wuhan along with 3 other Nearby cities have been declared quarantine zone yesterday. And today 9 other cities in Wubei province has been declared quarantine zone as well

[The news link](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1504605-20200124.htm) said 9 cities are seal off, but the most updated figure is 13

[Footage of](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220619393702318086)  Armed PLA guarding the entrance of Wuhan Railway station

[Footage of](https://youtu.be/AMZIabOVto8) a Wuhan citizen's narrative on the morning right after the quarantine. The city is quiet like a ghost town, 95% of the people on the street are wearing masks. Most of the shop has closed but shops like supermarket is still operating, there's currently no shortage of food except vegetables or instant noodles.

&#x200B;

Right before the quarantine was in effect, a lot of Wuhan citizens are escaped from their homes and quite a large amount of them claimed to have arrived at Shanghai because it is a large city and close to Wuhan, so Shanghai might as well be the next zone of outbreak

The Wubei provincial gov has just raised emergency alert level to level I, which is the level equivalent to nuclear disaster

360	t0fhd3	hya1rdc	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	Well the Russian people had better start making life really uncomfortable for Putin. They're about to take some very hard economic hits for his actions.
361	t0fhd3	hya12mk	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	The Russian people don’t want this. This is a dictator’s madness. He thinks the West is a paper tiger and won’t respond. We need to show him that despite the fact that the previous US president would bend over and spread his cheeks for him, there is a new sheriff in town. One that DOESNT owe Russian banks billions of dollars and is thus controlled by them. I’m hoping Putin is in for a rude surprise.
362	t0fhd3	hy9s767	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	Those people have some serious balls to be protesting the Russian government. Massive respect.
363	t0fhd3	hy9ubau	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	"I am Russian.

And today is the first time in my whole life that I feel ashamed for something someone else does. I feel ashamed for the invasion I never supported and take no part in.

I lived my whole life in Moscow. But I have relatives in the Russian south. My last name has Ukrainian origin. My aunt’s husband is Ukrainian. One of my classmates was a Ukrainian citizen and I met many Ukrainians in university.

It might be hard to understand or even believe for someone who doesn’t speak Russian, but my instagram, telegram and twitter feeds today consist of nothing but condemnation of the invasion by the Russian people. By celebrities and bloggers, by regular people I don’t know and by my friends and acquaintances. Same with my family.

A large chunk of Russian society has been apolitical for the last twenty years or so. For many it’s not an option anymore.

That invasion will have lasting consequences. And we will have to put a lot of work into mending the relationships Putin severed today.

I honestly feel like I can’t do much at the moment. But I hope that some non-Russian speakers will read this and clarify something: what happened today is the most unpopular among Russian citizens decision Putin has made in his entire presidency. By a large margin.

Today Putin made the decision of making the place I love and call home a terrorist pariah state.

I also want to apologise to all Ukrainians reading this. I can’t (and wouldn’t even if could) apologise on behalf of Putin or the current ruling elite. But nonetheless, the prospect of war was dismissed by general public in Russia up until the invasion started. And that disregard will be a scar every Russian will have to wear from now on. I am sorry."
364	t0fhd3	hybkoq8	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	"As a Russian who lives overseas I want to say thank you to everyone who understands the situation and has empathy to russian people. I hate that this is happening. I have a lot of Ukrainian friends and it’s truly awful to see how their families are suffering right now. We all are very close and almost everyone has a friend, relative or someone they know on the other end and we can’t comprehend why it’s happening.

It is so heartbreaking to see young soldiers to go to war that they don’t want to fight just because of our crazy president. The situation is really complicated because they do it out of fear for their families and their lives.

I’m almost crying while reading the support words that you guys write, especially after headings that I’ve seen recently “I hate Putin, I hate Russia”. Russia is not Putin, it’s much more than that. Putin is a fucking narcissist and psycho, one of the worst things that ever happened to Russia…

We have a great generation of empathetic, intelligent and friendly people and I believe that we will be able to bring a bright future in which Russia will not be seen as a constant aggressor…

I’m going to the protest in Sydney and will stand for Ukrainians in hope that it will help somehow. 

Thanks for the support guys and we will get through this tough times together!"
365	t0fhd3	hy9ez8g	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	Time to troll the Russian social media hard with wedge issues just like they do to Western democracies. Create some doubt and chaos for them for a change!
366	t0fhd3	hyaal80	Anti-war protests break out across Russia despite attempts to stifle them	"Dear Ukrainians!

I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed.

It's a lie.

If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.

"As a south african who was oppressed. I can honestly say, we have a fuckton of crime and corruption. But fuck man, we dont pull the shit america does. 

Our transition initially was fairly good. The only problem we have now is that as soon as something happens, people wanna blame it on apartheid instead of our corrupt leaders. The same ones those  who complain, put in power."

426	ktxv9e	gip1v0u	South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, says that they are willing to share their lessons from its peaceful transition to democracy with the US.	Not only was the transition of political power from the Apartheid government to the ANC not peaceful at all. South Africa as a country is a flawed democracy because there is no separation of powers between the Executive branch of government and Juridical branch of government because the President gets to appoint the Chief Justice which in turn has led to massive amount of corruption without consequences.

429	ktxv9e	gip0vie	South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, says that they are willing to share their lessons from its peaceful transition to democracy with the US.	"Reconciliation and Truth processes like those of South Africa and Spain have proven to be very defective in easing tensions and trully lead to ""reconciliation"". Grudges and resentment only grow when culprits of horrible crimes from both sides (when there are crimes from both sides) walk free.

You should look at Memory, Truth and Justice processes like that of Argentina, where criminals were persecuted even many years after they committed their crimes."

> A controversial episode of South Park - which was recently banned in China - was screened on a busy Hong Kong street in Sham Shui Po district on Tuesday night.

> The show was banned in China less than a week after a viral episode from Season 23 titled Band in China aired.

> Following censorship of the show&#039;s Band in China episode, Stone and Parker issued an &quot;Apology&quot; to the Chinese government on Monday and later included another jab at the country&#039;s politicians in South Park&#039;s 300th episode.

The vaccine did not do much in the way of treating existing masses, however I have not had any new tumors since taking the vaccine.

For context, from what small amount I know of the Choctaw's struggles, their relocation through the Trail of Tears happened during 1830-33 (broad dates) while our famine was approximately during 1845-49. The Choctaw tribe had experienced thousands of deaths during relocation and were about as destitute as one could imagine. I think that makes the donation all the more powerful. These people had nothing except for heartbreak and betrayal and when the plight of others reached their settlements they rallied together to give almost everything they had. All this born out of the understanding of pain the Irish were suffering and not wishing to see another race of people face those same torments. 

I'm not one for big internet posts or to get too emotional about this sort of stuff, but there's a special place in my heart for the Choctaw tribe and other Native Americans. I think it's one of the purest examples of the kindness and solidarity of people, something the modern world has forgotten a bit too often."

Many low age of consents deal with romeo and juliet laws. They have specific conditions where it applies.

I.E a 17 year old not going to jail for sleeping with a 14-15 year old. Or an 18 year not going to jail for sleeping with a 16 year old.

So if you just go to Japan and fuck a 13 year old you still most likely be in trouble as the consent laws for that location could be 18.

Japan is not actually a pedo paradise. And raising the national average is more of a symbolic gesture that will not likely change anything.

561	mnerwn	gtx5ss1	Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and consort to Queen Elizabeth II, dies aged 99	"He did not die. He completed life.

Pity he couldn't make it to 100.

I feel a bit for Queen Elizabeth, one of the loneliest people in the world... yeah, she's a queen, she's rich, she has servants catering to every whim, she has her family, but who else in the world can get her? personal friends she had along the years are probably dying or all dead already. Nobody else has worn the crown as long as her in the entire history of her nation. Who's her peer? who's her equal? who's someone who can truly know what it's like to live as the embodimient and the personification of an institution, of a nation, for nearly 70 years??? who really understands what it's like to be Queen Elizabeth? the only one who could just died. 

I know it's weird to feel sympathy for a literal queen, but come on, she's human too. She's the last connection to history for our generation, actually for 2-3 generations. She's the only person alive who worked with WINSTON CHURCHILL (I mean, there must surely be some young people back then, involved in minor roles of the government, who are still alive, but when it comes to big names, to decisive rulers or head of states, she's the only one alive to have worked with the man that defeated Hitler). She's history alive, and Prince Philip was as well.

RIP Philip, enjoy in the afterlife seeing Matt Smith portraying you in your glory youth days!"

He sat through our presentations in the gym, didn't appear too impressed in retrospect.

When he spoke, he said that it's not all 'doom and gloom' and that is why organizations like the WWF exist.

He did a walkabout, asked some kids if they played football. Oh no, it's too violent, we play soccer. He didn't seem impressed with that either and moved on. That was funny in retrospect.

He ordered the school board to give us a day off from school, so he won some fans

I tried telling a teacher at my Junior High the next year that he had visited my elementary school, she called me a liar in front of the whole class. I told her to phone the school, she refused. She asked why he would visit my elementary school, I mentioned the WWF and she got wide-eyed.

Also, perhaps my favourite Prince Philip story is when he was serving during WWII. The vessel he was on came under attack from a bomber during the night. It missed on its first run but was coming around for a second. With quick thinking attributed to the Prince, he ordered the launch of a wooden raft and for it to be set ablaze.    

The wooden raft served its purpose and confused the bomber as it dove engines screaming towards the ship and dropped its bombs on the raft instead giving the ship time to make a hasty exit."

I was head of quality for one of the Aldi countries for a couple of years. At that time (4-5 years ago) sustainability was a complete novel thing that was just a side task of one of the buyers. They started hiring a small sustainability team that made quite some local impact.

Though i have to be critical at the set goal. A goal of making all packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable can be abused. Technically almost all plastics are recyclable, therefore it would meet such a requirement. The goal is to **ensure** that the packaging is indeed recycled, reused or composted, which is much harder. 

I have worked with many packaging suppliers, they all try this trick of marketing their packaging as recyclable. Which is technically true, but in practice 0% of that packaging would be recycled as there was no return stream set up or no recyclers accepting that material."

639	pjthms	hbzg5sj	Mexico decriminalizes abortion, a dramatic step in world’s second-biggest Catholic country	"FWIW I've found some of this article's contents helpful in speaking to religious people about abortion(towards favoring more tolerance/legality):

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/27/opinion/biden-bishops-communion-abortion.html?referringSource=articleShare

> ... No one told “Matthew” or “Mark” or “Luke” or “John” or Paul, or any other New Testament author, that he should condemn this(abortion) sin of all sins. Nor did any author of the Old Testament raise this alarm, with the result that we do not have Moses or Jesus on record as opposing abortion. Nor did any of the major definitive creeds.

> Even major figures of religious history do not tell us that the fetus is a person. St. Augustine says he searched Scripture trying but failing to find out when in the procreative process personal life begins. But St. Thomas Aquinas knew. Aristotle told him — that it came at or near childbirth, after an earlier stage of having a nutritive soul (like plant life), which developed into an animal soul, at last receiving a rational soul. Thomas kept Aristotle’s biology, just adding that God himself infuses the soul into the body at some unspecified time during the last stage of this process. In other words, the fetus in its long pre-rational life is not a human being.

> ... the Catholic theologian Bernard Häring points out that at least half of the fertilized eggs fail to achieve “nidation” — adherence to the uterus — making nature and nature’s God guilty of a greater “holocaust” of unborn babies than abortion accounts for, if the fertilized ovum is a “baby.”"

655	ewb1jk	fg0sp0p	Coronavirus is declared global emergency by World Health Organization as outbreak continues to spread outside China	"For people who are wondering what that means, I found [this](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/480705-heres-what-could-happen-if-who-declares): 

>The declaration gives WHO certain capabilities to ramp up the response of governments and organizations around the globe who are rushing to contain the illness in several ways, including sending the message to the world that the outbreak is indeed a serious health emergency. 

>The designation pushes nations to work together as much as they can to coordinate personnel, funds and other valuable resources. The declaration also helps in persuading residents in infected countries to abide by health and hygiene recommendations. 

>When WHO’s Emergency Committee declares a PHEIC, it allows WHO to put travel advisories in place for cities, regions and countries, such as those used in outbreaks like the 2003 SARS epidemic. WHO also has the ability to review public health measures carried out by countries to ensure they are up to the proper health standards.

Edit: just want to note that when I posted this, the article was basically two sentences without a lot of detail."
656	ewb1jk	fg0rpny	Coronavirus is declared global emergency by World Health Organization as outbreak continues to spread outside China	I‘ve previously seen a lot of people condemning the WHO for not declaring an emergency earlier, but in all honesty, their rationale does make sense. They were looking at the world stage, and up until recently, it truly was a China-centric emergency. Essentially everyone who was sick had directly travelled to Wuhan beforehand, there was (and still is) zero deaths outside of China, near-zero cases of H2H spread in any international countries until recently, and international governments were all on board with properly containing the spread for afflicted patients in their country. There wasnt anything constituting an emergency on the overall world stage, simply just within China. Declaring an emergency would have just induced unnecessary panic at the time, and had the potential to ‘devalue’ the importance of a future emergency if this whole situation blew over.

“Pliny the Elder wrote that the tomb of the hero was on the island.”

“According to Greek myths the island was created by Poseidon for Achilles and Helen to inhabit, but also for sailors to have an island to anchor at the Euxine Sea…”

“The Greeks during the Ottoman Empire renamed it Fidonisi (Greek: Φιδονήσι, ""Snake Island"") “

That goes for President Zelensky too, who has refused to flee the country and continues to offer words of support for his fellow citizens."

It sucks, but the propaganda they’re being told is along the lines of “Ukrainians are persecuting Russians, Zelensky is arming every Ukrainian, he’s letting prisoners out of jail and giving them guns to use against Russians” etc, while ignoring that it’s a war going on."

I'm not sure how they're represented today but back then they were overall pretty disgusting degenerates that would come together against truly evil things happening. Back then global media didn't cover much on the internet and Anonymous would help make wrongs right that weren't getting the attention they deserved. They were clever, but mostly loud.

Now Anonymous seems filled with some very intelligent capable people doing things I'm not sure we've seen on a global scale before. Seems like a lot of those degens grew up to be some pretty savy tech gods. Glad to see them still taking down the worst of the scum"

Russia is t fighting for it's life, just for power and conquest. 

Ukraine has the upper hand in morale, they're fighting for their lives.

On top of that, it isn't too far fetched to think that killing their neighbors in an assult is a moral delimma for a decent amount of Russian troops, some of them are bound to have ties with Ukraine which may ""effect their aim"" 

Without human factors like these Russia should steam roll Ukraine but with the will of the people and outrage of the Russian population.

920	eljp1u	fdihh2t	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	Hi, I would like to not go to war please
921	eljp1u	fdiu0ki	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	"So let's take a moment and speculate about the realities at play here.

1) Thanks to the last several decades of war our country has undertaken, we have gotten VERY good at defending against these types of attacks. We have multiple capabilities available to destroy the ballistic missiles used by the majority of our adversaries. From the Phalanx systems to Patriots to airborne anti-missile technology, this is at best a minimal effort on behalf of Iran. Be concerned when they send multiples of dozens toward a limited number of targets.

2) Iran is not stupid, neither are their leaders or their people. More than that, THEY do not want this to escalate. Decades of sanctions and restrictions on them have taken their toll, the last thing they want is war. They KNOW it will be the end of their current regime and their immense regional influence will wane quickly. They're in a good spot geopolitically, even AFTER the killing of Major General Soleimani. Their leaders and diplomats are playing this well so far, including a limited retaliatory strike against only military targets nearby. They also had to be well aware of my statements in #1 above, but they've played their hand and are likely hoping this can be the end of it.

3) The US President also knows he's gotten himself cornered at this point, the lack of casualties so far in this missile attack gives him breathing room though. He's overlooked minimal damage to the drone in the past and the calculus here is MUCH greater. I also believe that the heavy rotation of the video of him saying that President Obama would do this very thing is him making himself look stupid. He's got no way out of that video because it's not come CNN analyst saying that a failing President would engage in conflict with Iran, it is literally HIMSELF. Even he won't accuse himself of fake news...though no one mention deep fakes to him. I seriously think his video from 2011 has an affect on his decision making in this situation.

4) Anyone criticizing our military leaders for offering him the OPTION to kill MG Soleimani should understand the military decision making process first. In military planning, at some level, you ALWAYS include throw away courses of action. They aren't COAs that aren't viable, but they're usually intended to drive thought and consideration for the more palatable options. In this case they made a blunder assuming that the CinC would have even a rudimentary understanding of this process three years into the job.

So, I am hoping for hopes sake that this is the end of kinetic operations in this cluster fuck of a situation. Iran appears to be more level headed and strategic here than our President and that bodes well unless we choose not to seize on the opportunity for diplomacy here. I'm nervous about the next day or two, but I'm optimistic based on all my worldly observations and experiences."
922	eljp1u	fdig4dx	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	I hope the soldiers are safe. I *would* say that I hope things can be cooled down, but I think at this point, with this development, that ship has sailed. My hope is that, whatever happens, the ordinary people of Iran and Iraq do not suffer, because none of this is their doing.
923	eljp1u	fdj7nh4	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	Can we just all agree that no one wants a fucking war with anyone. Let’s just look at memes together and travel. No one has time to kill and die for rich people

927	eljp1u	fdivqva	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	"In another post a couple days ago someone posted this quote and it reminded me of the show. 

Father Mulcahy: War is hell

Hawkeye: War isn’t Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse. 

Father Mulcahy: How do you figure that, Hawkeye? Hawkeye: Easy, Father. Tell me, who goes to Hell? 

Father Mulcahy: Sinners, I believe. 

Hawkeye: Exactly. There are no innocent bystanders in Hell. War is chock full of them — little kids, cripples, old ladies. In fact, except for some of the brass, almost everybody involved is an innocent bystander. 

-M*A*S*H

Just think everyone should read this no matter what political side you take. No one wins while fighting a war. Donald Trump doesn't win, Iran Doesn't win, and we all certainly won't win. It will be us fighting that war and not the ones who started it. 

Trump chose a short sighted option on a list with probably better options. He chose this either knowing or not knowing the consequences and how he responds will decide whether or not we go to war. People chose to elect a man who has never had to make a hard or well thought out decision in his life. All he did was pick a choice and here we are. He is easily manipulated, weak, and the opposite of presidential. You could argue that he made the right call but the ones who know whether it was the right call or not are saying it wasn't."
928	eljp1u	fdiew43	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	"Tit for tat military practices create a bunch of losers. No one wins.

Edit: I quickly realized from the help of a lot of you that this attack wasn’t necessarily tit for tat. I should have rephrased my original comment to say aggressive retaliation creates losers. Tit for tat suggests equal responses which has not been the case in the timeline of these events."
929	eljp1u	fdinyi2	Multiple rockets hit Taji base in Iraq	"As an iraqi im pretty fucking pissed we're becoming the playground AGAIN, it's been over 40 years of war in this country give us a fucking break.

930	fsgzya	fm25fds	'Dictatorships often start in the face of a threat': UN privacy chief warns against long-lasting theft of freedoms amid coronavirus surveillance	"I feel like they mainly wanted to address Hungary without specifically mentioning Hungary.

For those unaware of the background: Their current leader has done shit in the past to get himself more and more power, to the point where you could call them dictatorial tendencies. A bit similar to what Erdogan (Turkey's president) has been doing.

Because of the corona virus they now declared a state of emergency, giving the government **unlimited** power. And it's not like it's the only country that declared a state of emergency so far, but the other countries have at least end date, and they still don't have that much power compared to Hungary. If those countries wanted to continue it after the set date, it has to be voted on again.

Hungary has no end date. It's basically on, until this party and their leader (that has in the past shown he likes to be leader 4 life) gives those powers up."

You have to fight to keep them because people in power want nothing more than to make every one of us powerless peons.

I’ve been sounding the alarm on fascism for a few years now and some have scoffed at me. But even here in Canada our LIBERAL government tried to have unlimited powers bestowed upon them in this time of crisis. And these asshats are fucking fuzzy kittens compared to a lot of others out there at this point in time.

Don’t say you all weren’t warned. The fucking sirens have just been blaring for so long that people have been ignoring them."
932	fsgzya	fm1yko7	'Dictatorships often start in the face of a threat': UN privacy chief warns against long-lasting theft of freedoms amid coronavirus surveillance	Make sense.  The vast majority of civil rights that are suspended or withdrawn are done under the pretext or guise of an emergency.

956	7g4za4	dqgz4oq	“No one owns Internet... so, it should be open and accessible to everyone,” says the Chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.	"Also for anyone who tells you that ""Net Neutrality is solving a problem that doesn't exist""... or anything along those lines:

Here's a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:

MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

Trump and his goons[GOP] are nothing but cowards."

The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup d'état (Persian: کودتای ۲۸ مرداد‎), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953,[5] orchestrated by the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project[6] or ""Operation Ajax"") and the United Kingdom (under the name ""Operation Boot"").[7][8][9][10] It was the first covert action of the United States to overthrow a foreign government during peacetime.[11]

"And in true Trump-fashion, after this obvious move being well-documented, he will STILL go on Fox News or take to Twitter to claim that ""If Iran had a problem with what we did, why didn't a diplomat come to the UN?"" Not only will he say that, his supporters will defend him for saying that. Just calling it now."

990	94ivyd	e3ln6th	School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	"Guys, just want to let the whole world know this, tomorrow will occur a huge genocide. Govt will kill hundreds if not thousands of students, pedestrians, general public, rape female students and woman by letting their own-breed of criminals, thugs and Gangsters which is known as ""Chatro-League"" &""Jubo-League"". They have already started taking steps of doing this, they are turning off mobile networks, blocking social media and Since they terrorize our media every now and then; our media won't even say a single word on this or worst; they will deny everything since confessing means giving up their lives. Trust me, every year US Ambassador Marcia Bernicat give us a visit to our country for some bullshit human rights, for killing drug dealers, thieves, murderers and all other sorts of criminals to tell Govt that even those criminals have rights but when Govt is killing us and they are planning to kill even more, where is she?

For the past 10-12 years, people can't even speak their mind, they can't practice healthy politics but practicing politics is our human rights, even an underage person can put his/her opinion regarding politics cause each and every day, our lives are being controlled very poorly by these crooked Ministers and Members but if someone try to speak their mind, they either get tainted with terrorist political group ""Ja-m-at"" or ""JMB"" and BNP (Bangladesh National Party). So according to our Govt, speaking good about the Govt and always licking their ass is known as ""Healthy Politics"" and not supporting them means either supporting those leftover criminal parties or getting a tag for ""Conspiracy against Govt"".

Tomorrow, This whole world will only know, People of Bangladesh died for independence, proper conveniences and opportunities but there will be no evidence. All those 1st world countries, you guys don't deserve these title. I don't want to die just like you guys, I don't want my child to grow up in a crooked and corrupted  society and criminally unfair law, I don't want my child to grow up and become like one of these drug addict, murderous Ministers or Thugs, YES,JUST LIKE YOU GUYS! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WE ARE NOT THAT FORTUNATE BUT OUR HOPES AND DREAMS ARE ALL SAME.

God Bless the world and the 1st world countries for giving us fake hopes. If you want to see slavery, destruction of freedom of speech, destruction of all sort of Human rights, Just come and see for yourself just for 10 minutes of our current situation. It will be hard for you guys to believe that you will be watching these in 2018 and feel like someone traveled time to record these 1500 century stuffs.

I urge everyone to attach every clips that we have gathered. Before we die, world needs to know how we got killed by our dictator-like Govt."

Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	"Note that most of the demostrators are kids (middle and high school), wherease the student wings (Chhatra League mentioned in the article belongs to Awami League, the current ruling party) of political parties attacking them are adults (university students).

Also, take everything that comes out of Bangladesh with a house-sized grain of salt.

Source: Lived there for 4 years, saw political upheaval regularly."
994	94ivyd	e3lkycx	School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	"BBC news (normally an impartial-ish source) says

 ""Police used tear gas as they tried to control the crowds on Saturday.

Local journalists told the BBC they were among those beaten up by pro-government students, and they reported having their camera equipment destroyed.

Amid reports of sexual assaults in the streets, a female reporter alleged on social media that she had been ""molested"" while trying to film the clashes.""

No report of any deaths... Weird"

Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	Please remember this, everything you normally hear about Bangladesh in the international media is sugarcoated. Bangladesh is a democratic country for show only. Freedom of speech is suppressed, the government is totalitarian, and they actively target, abduct, or beat up dissenters. The prime minister might be considered to be some icon for feminism, humanity, whatever by ousiders but we absolutely hate all ministers (including the prime minister) bar some. We are regularly threatened by BCL (the student political body), they've committed countless atrocities. You might hear about Bangladesh doing well economically but what good is that when you can't even be safe? Minorities like the indigenous people, refugees, Hindus and Christians are brutally discriminated. The military has no accountability, they can do whatever they want. It can be called an absolute shithole since you have no say, and human rights are breached regularly. The worst thing is that since corruption is so rampant, there's hardly anything we can do. And if we do try, they accuse us of being against the nation or the freedom fighters, they just manipulate patriotic sentiments. Even as we speak, the government is suing and arresting people who posted videos and pictures on social media. They're saying that we are spreading misinformation and absolutely nothing happened today. It's a total shitshow.
996	94ivyd	e3luiji	School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	"A female friend of mine was trapped near the protests, where the action escalated this afternoon, and after all the shit I read about rapes and sexual assaults, I just up and left to get her.  


While we got out of there safe, the place was a fucking mess -- I saw a kid being dragged out by two other guys, sobbing like there's no tomorrow, and a fair degree of blood drying on the asphalt. But the most incredible part was that some of the students were still adamantly controlling the flow of traffic in a way that makes the roads safe (this is what triggered the movement in the first place).  


I really hope this incident gets more attention from the international media, because our media houses are either scared shitless of the consequences of reporting on such incidents or are basically nothing more than propaganda machines (I work at the newspaper cited in this post, by the way)."
