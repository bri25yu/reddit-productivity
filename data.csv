How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?"
2	k4qide	geabksk	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"If they had said ""It was an orgy that involved sexual acts between 7 men"" I would have been like ""WHOA! The anti-gay guy, 7 dudes? That's a lot!!"" 

But it's 25. 25 men. A 25 man orgy. That's not an orgy, that's Carnival level.

(A note. Being gay, totally awesome and fine. So are orgies, straight or gay. But the thick layer of goddamn hypocrisy covering the whole thing is indefensible and unforgivable.)"

""I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community,"" he added.”

So “strictly personal” for him but not any other person that is LGBTQ.  Got it. 

“Oh and please don’t tell the people back home I’m a fucking hypocrite”."
6	k4qide	gea94mz	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	25 men is a lot of men for a homophobe
7	k4qide	gedco59	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	As a Hungarian, I am totally ashamed of what our government does. What they advocate in the country is ridiculous (forcing christianity insanely so as anti-lmbtq) and whatever they do their reason is either “George Soros” or “Brussels” or “Migrants”. Such a shameful country with even more sad acts. Now clearly several times the government (Fidesz) was busted with scandals such as one of a Hungarian city’s major got caught having an orgy with a bunch of cocaine and hookers on a yacht which was presumably bought and maintained by the taxpayers money or the pedophile case which was conducted by another diplomat related to the government and now this idiot...
8	k4qide	geahvvg	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	Not very surprising. If you are that focused on other people’s sexual preferences, it is a dead giveaway that you are either trying to control your own urges, a complete idiot, or, as is most often the case, both.
9	k4qide	geadcag	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"> Szájer, who fronted Fidesz in the European Parliament, helped rewrite Hungary's constitution to ""protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman,""

Because of course, it's not enough for themselves to be in the closet, they need everyone else with them and if they won't hide who they are then they must be shamed.

Fuck this guy.

100% of voting Republicans voted no on both articles. 99% of Democrats voted yes on both articles. Only one independent representative *existed*.

By contrast, the nay [votes on Andrew Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson) were split 50/50. And 15 out of 100 votes across the [Republican vote on Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton) were nay.

There is a clear adherence to party lines rather than public opinion or observation of the evidence. We could have just skipped the entire proceedings and gone straight to the vote. Why should we be okay with this?"

My only hope is that this dissent is strong enough to bring an end to this horrible regime. Warmongering tyrants need to meet the fate that they deserve to deter any future incursions. Ultimately, I will not be upset if Putin is found hanging from a streetlight by the end of this war.

I do not believe that Russia was the first to enter the border of Ukraine. Putin would not have made such a stupid decision. I'm sorry, of course, but it seems to me that the European Union and America are deliberately provoking Russia to such actions in order to eventually capture us”

How can you believe that after The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation announced that they will detain ""participants of unauthorized actions in the regions"" if they go to rallies against the war with Ukraine

I am from Russia, but I have Ukrainian roots. I am terrified. Russia has long been in the ass, everything is becoming more expensive. Now it will get even worse. People think about their survival and do not want to become cannon fodder. Rallies are not coordinated, those who go to rallies are imprisoned. The security forces are on Putin's side. If earlier I went to a rally, then later, after the birth of a child, I will not go. If they put me in jail, who will take care of him? Matvienko calls those who are against the war terrorists.

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Edit2: yes I posted this many times. I like hearing people’s response to my views."

We know. At some point, everyone has thought about it. Human nature implies greed and corruption. This isn't the first time and, without a doubt, it won't be the last scandal of corruption. I could go on, but then I'd be descending into off-putting, philosophical ramblings. So I'll just skip to the point.

Don't believe that you can't do anything as an individual. Even the barest minimum of effort from one person can amount to something when it's combined with the barest minimums of millions.

Find a way that's comfortable for you to do your part, whether it's a phone call to a senator, a conversation with an uninformed person, an upvote on an important post (such as this), or a signature on a petition. Or maybe, if you really want to show support, go full activist and attend rallies, protests, volunteer movements, etc..

Corruption is an inherent flaw in the system. The best way to combat it is to bring it to light. Be vigilant and do your part, however small it may be.

Or don't. It's your choice."

"From the ""About the Panama Papers"" section on the site, in case you want a quick summary: ""Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.

In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.

The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes."""

"Good. Sydney absolutely relies on the fireworks as it's main tourist draw, not just for the fireworks themselves but to showcase the city globally for other visitors.

People book up years in advance, what are you going to tell those tourists? There is no link between the fireworks and bushfires, and the smoke from the fireworks is tiny compared to even a small bushfire.

Cancelling the fireworks would be tantamount NSW shooting itself in the foot. Tourism is a vital segment of the economy, visitor numbers will be depressed enough already, without effectively covering the shop window.

The environment is important, global warming is real and needs broad, effective action. Bushfires are a tragedy and the Federal government's response is a joke. However, cancelling the fireworks is a stupid, self-defeating idea"

"I am brand new to Reddit, and the vitriolic responses to my first post left the clear impression that political machinery tries to manipulate this medium. I know nothing about this ‘Net Neutrality’ issue, but fortunately my daughter does. She agrees that rolling back current protections will hurt Internet freedom.

The attacks on Trump, etc., intended to garner support made me suspicious, but my daughter, who is far from some political hack, convinced me that we need to stop the FCC in this case."

If you could've voted for Hillary and didn't YOU VOTED FOR THIS (whether you knew it or not).

Why don't we all organize a mass cancellation of service to all internet providers just like we do with our senators and congressman.

"I have hesitated talking about certain past life experiences for the sake of just not putting any sort of spot light but you know what, fuck it, this is important. I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.

Now, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.

First of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.

First of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??

Censorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.

Will there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?

This is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to ""unlock reddit"".

I try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.

I am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse. Please Americans, do not do this to yourselves, value what you have without having to learn just how much it means to all of you because it was taken away."

> The couple, who could not be reached for comment, were able to hold about 8m CHF with the bank before their accounts were closed in 2006.One former Credit Suisse employee at the time alleges there was a deeply ingrained culture in Swiss banking of looking the other way when it came to problematic clients.

My friend worked at a ""local"" bank and they were advised to show wealthy clients ways to circumvent taxes for their holiday homes. Many of our local people cant afford living in towns, wich became famous ski resorts, because rent exploded and rich investors bought all the property, using them 2 weeks a year. We had to make a legislation against it. We payed the UBS 70 billion to save them from bankruptcy after 2008. a private bank. Wealthy people can evade communal tax by giving them a set amount, to pay less than they should (eg. Tina Turner, Elton John, Petula Clark).

Even though I took a class that was nearly an exact replica of this one back when I was in Community College. The only difference? The CC Prof gave us the book in pdf for free if we read his syllabus all the way. 

UW's choice of book? Fucking Cengage and their access codes. I have to pay to do homework. Usually if you need a code, you're going to be doing homework on that platform. Access codes are a scam and promotes lazy grading and cut/paste classroom formats. Every single class I've taken that used Cengage or Pearson (mostly Math), the grading style was exactly the same, do the homework that is available on the website.

(NEWSFLASH: This promotes cheating since everyone knows what google search does)

These homework assignments were always due the morning of class or the following night usually ranging 20 to 40 problems. The few classes that didn't use an access code had the most active professors I've ever had. My Diff EQ class was the best and hardest time of my life because the professor made our homework and tests from scratch but also made sure the topic was understood.

Lying on applications is classed as fraud and punishable by a fine and/or custodial sentence.

Given that Sir Green has means to pay his own staff, the ability to support his businesses himself and pays no UK tax (or as little as he can get away with) I would say that would/should bar him and anyone else (Daniel Levy/Richard Branson) asking for a bailout.  

And if you are given taxpayer funds you should find your company part nationalised so an allocated member of civil service permanently placed on the board until you pay back what you took."

The Mexican president sold himself as a Bernie Sanders, for and with the people, but has shown he's Mexican Trump, denying cold facts, encouraging corruption, never taking responsibility and refusing to wear a mask.

> Al-Halaq&#039;s killing has been slammed as an &quot;Extrajudicial killing,&quot; and has resurfaced pain within the Palestinian community, who say they have long been targeted and gunned down by Israeli police and military for nothing more than being Palestinian.

> Al-Halaq&#039;s untimely death has coincided with the May 25 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with many Palestinian activists and allies drawing parallels between Israel&#039;s slaying of Palestinians and the rampant killings of unarmed black men in the U.S at the hands of the police.

I am from Hong Kong, so we are not under the censorship of CCP (yet) and we have some accesses to what the mainland China people shared on the social media, and we are quite concerned on the situation as Hong Kong was hit badly by the SARS 17 years ago

The confirmed cases released by CCP gov is some 800 infected now, but some Wuhan residents said there were at least 10,000+ cases and the hospitals are flooded with patients

[1st Footage](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220015683964026880) : The narrator said : ""I'm showing you the real situation in hospital here (showing the quarantine tents all around), If your family have children and could stay at home, just stay, don't go out!

[There is a footage](https://youtu.be/oY64klryE9E) of medical staff facing mental breakdown with the overwhelming situation

He was saying : There are patients lying all over the floor of the hospital! We worked for 4 shift per day! Are you not going to let us live?! I can't do this more..... get them (the patients) out! get them out! I can't do this anymore!

The whole city of Wuhan along with 3 other Nearby cities have been declared quarantine zone yesterday. And today 9 other cities in Wubei province has been declared quarantine zone as well

[The news link](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1504605-20200124.htm) said 9 cities are seal off, but the most updated figure is 13

[Footage of](https://twitter.com/badiucao/status/1220619393702318086)  Armed PLA guarding the entrance of Wuhan Railway station

[Footage of](https://youtu.be/AMZIabOVto8) a Wuhan citizen's narrative on the morning right after the quarantine. The city is quiet like a ghost town, 95% of the people on the street are wearing masks. Most of the shop has closed but shops like supermarket is still operating, there's currently no shortage of food except vegetables or instant noodles.

&#x200B;

Right before the quarantine was in effect, a lot of Wuhan citizens are escaped from their homes and quite a large amount of them claimed to have arrived at Shanghai because it is a large city and close to Wuhan, so Shanghai might as well be the next zone of outbreak

It raises every year and the taxes on the rich is a fucking joke because it just affects wage earners and isnt a real ""taxing the rich"". I say this is a kiwi that our country is fucked with a high child poverty rate, high rates of teen suicide, infastructure that cant handle the current population, housing prices that our own citizens cant afford and politicions doing nothing about it besides making an annoucement that they're gonna have an annoucement on it. There is a big reason why there is a brain drain, and even more so once the world opens back up from the young and skilled workforce because a lot of us don't see any future here for us.

Just assuming that everyone is going to make more post inflation money as a result of higher minimum wage.

Also tax raises for the rich? Lol nope. Tax hikes on the middle class. New Zealand has no capital gains or dividend taxes. Only people with employment income are going to be paying higher rates.

This article writes that this is magically going to be a huge boost in the economy, but taxes and minimum wage come with dead weight loss. That's basic economics. This is likely going to blow up in their faces.

This could still *be good policy* mind you, but the writing implies there's literally no potential downsides, and no potential losers."

381	fhmpsi	fkcgawc	Coronavirus Vaccine Made In Saskatchewan Canada Is Now In The Testing Stages	"I believe I read that China is also close to a vaccine, and they plan to actually test it in extreme cases relatively soon... skipping testing altogether. (Or at least, doing testing but also doing live experiments).

Edit: Extreme cases was badly worded on my part, but the original story was also pretty... circumspect on the details. I assumed the implication was they intended to use it on high-risk cases. Maybe they plan to test on prisoners, or 80+ year old cancer patients, or something. 

Which is... interesting, and terrifying. But seems this is a time for terrifying."

One big concern recently raised a symposium discussing ways to tackle COVID was that if a vax isn't developed right, it could actually make things WORSE via a mechanism called antibody dependent enhancement (ADE):

 It allows people with the BNO passport to come for 12 months as opposed to 6 months."
413	gvjbhx	fspilcz	Boris Johnson says 3m people in Hong Kong will get path to British citizenship	"This is actually very interesting news, because one of the main differences between HK and, say, the Falkland Islands is that HK has a far bigger population than the Falklands. Back in the 1980s (when reversion to Chinese rule was being discussed) one of the reasons why Thatcher was willing to hand over Hong Kong was the knowledge that you couldn't evacuate millions of Hong Kong people the way you could a few thousand Falklanders if things went wrong.

Now Johnson is saying the opposite - that the UK *can* absorb Hong Kong's emigres.

Very interesting to see how."

449	7ug4pb	dtk8jtn	Cancer ‘vaccine’ eliminates tumors in mice - 90 of 90 mice cured of cancers with lymphoma, similar results observed in colon, breast, and melanoma cancers.	"OK, so it's important to pump the brakes here a bit - let's go over a few major major caveats to this study.

1. This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address.
2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving).
3. From the paper itself: ""We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment."" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already.
4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.

I've seen comment that we are ignorant and racist to lump all Native Americans into the same group. And that we are short sighted to assume Choctaw = Najavo. Most people here know that these are different peoples, separated by hundreds of miles within the continent that is North America. But the one thing we all have in common (Ireland, Najavo, Choctaw, all native Americans) is that we have all suffered greatly from colonialism, we've all had out land taken from us, we've all been forced to relocate (Trail of Tears, To Hell or to Connaught), we've all been brutalised and murdered by a larger power. Irish people sympathise with that, and this is a case of paying it forward, not paying it back.

We will gladly never settle this debt with Choctaw, and I imagine anytime the Irish learn of an indigenous people suffering, we'll be there to give a helping hand."

then a local newspaper reached to her which she denied any involvement in the incident and most newspaper puplished that she has nothing to do with the evergiven ship , but still some people where making fun of women driving and stupid shit like that .
I have deep respect for her and wish her a successful career .
also the headline is sketchy as fuck since she has not been blamed by any governmental institution or losing her job .
in fact she was honored by the current president for being the first female captain about a year ago which may have helped spreading the rumors ."

One of the best things Jacinda did during this was listening to the experts and make sure that their info was conveyed clearly, calmly and often. 1 pm broadcasts every day where she and Dr. Bloomfield would answer questions and give updates on the situation: how many cases were found today and where, what our running total was, updates on how businesses would be affected, etc. She deferred to Bloomfield for the medical questions because she knows he's the expert on those. She handled the press gracefully and took their questions (even the stupid ones \*cough Tova\*). When I look at Boris, Donald, and Scomo I feel very very grateful to live here with Jacinda as PM.

Just to address the trust in leaders thing, here in South Africa, they hit the ground running with bullshit policies and regulations and it's been a complete clown show since. They banned cigarettes because ""when people zol they put saliva on da paper and then they share dat paper"". The shortage of cigarettes since then has caused more people than ever to share their cigarettes. And everyone knows that the person enforcing these laws is making big bucks from the illegal trade.

It's currently illegal to visit friends or family, even if you know 100% they're not infected, but you're allowed to go to church with 50 other strangers or fill up a minibus taxi. The government allocated a couple of billion towards the cause, which has been (surprise surprise) all looted and never made it to its destination. Tax money goes exclusively towards increasing our politicians' belt sizes yearly. And they've been talking about sorting out corruption for around 20 years now but when it comes to actually doing anything about it, the culprits instead end up with promotions.

And we're completely fucked here with this virus.

559	k8dyxc	gexrvpn	Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé named top plastic polluters for third year in a row	The market is incredibly competitive for these cheap product producers. If they set out a plan of replacing plastic by something else, it will simply affect their profit margin, causing a reduction in their ability to keep the prices the same as before. The only way these companies can really become socially responsible and en environmentally responsible is if consumers are willing to purchase their products at a réatively higher price. In that way, they’ll be willing to use less plastic and replace it with another material since the increase in price doesn’t affect demand hat much. Before companies become environmentally responsible, we, as consumers, must first be environmentally responsible.

576	i65se9	g0tv0q2	World's largest vaccine manufacturer in Maharashtra, India wants to cap vaccine price at $3	"I just want to point out that the $3 cost is the target ""cap"" price for the Gates Foundation. In all likelihood, poorer areas will have their cost further subsidized down to free or nearly-free. Everyone complaining that it ""should be free"" is kinda misreading the point of this statement. They're trying to set the **maximum** price to $3 to prevent shady clinics and middle-men from excessively marking-up vaccine prices when the vaccines become available. $3 is not the actual price that people will pay in impoverished areas. It's the maximum amount.

Why is this important? They need to get the word out that the price cap is $3 so that, by the time in January or whenever the vaccine is available, the general public will be aware that the price is supposed to be under $3. This will help against markups and the oncoming flood of black market vaccine sellers.

It's smart to set an early, easily-remembered cap price on vaccines and broadly publicize it so that people can tell when they're being ripped off. It also has the side-benefit of psychologically anchoring people to the idea of a $3 vaccine in countries that aren't impoverished. The Gates Foundation and Serum Institute can drive down the price of different vaccines in the US and elsewhere just by popularizing the idea of $3 vaccines to the world.

It's a good, catchy idea: 3 dollar vaccines. It's like the 5 dollar footlong sandwich at Subway, which was catchy enough that it made people reluctant to buy from Subways that weren't honoring the price. I hope 3 dollar vaccines takes off. The Gates foundation maybe should come up with an annoying ad jingle."

Thai government is screening for fever at airports, we know that incubation period for this virus is long, screening for fever is ineffective.

Thai government will keep infections secret as much as possible. To keep tourism numbers up.

People will take the virus home from Thailand to the rest of the world after their holidays are finished.


Thailand should have stopped all flights to and from china. It's too late for that now.

Instead the Thai government have been promoting tourism with slogans like ""don't worry keep shopping"" and free tickets to events in Pattaya for Thai tourists (internal tourism).

Thailands government should be held responsible for their actions."

671	dr09w3	f6d3k1n	Microsoft Japan’s experiment with a 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40%.	Worked a job for awhile where we could either work five 8 hour days or four 10 hour days each week.  I was already working 10 hour days so It was a no brainer. Having every Friday off was awesome.  There’s so much stuff you can’t get done on weekends because businesses are closed - could get everything done on Friday and actually have Saturday free.  If I did take Friday off for myself and do something fun,  the crowds were always smaller because people were at work.  Loved having this option.
672	dr09w3	f6dx6lo	Microsoft Japan’s experiment with a 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40%.	Only logical thing to do is make everyone work 7 days a week. Cant have people being productive and happy.

677	dr09w3	f6cxrqb	Microsoft Japan’s experiment with a 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40%.	Depends on the country. Workers in Japan are notorious for sitting long hours at their desks doing nothing. It's a unique part of the culture. Not so in Germany, the UK, or the US, unless you work for a poorly managed company - people's work days are shorter, but they already work steadily during the 8 hours/day they are at work.

“the vaccines will be free to New Zealanders” (no word on whether they’ll be free to the other pacific nations but I imagine they will be)"
751	kek042	gg33pn5	New Zealand secures enough vaccine for all New Zealanders, and six pacific nations	"For comparison though New Zealand has about half the population of New York City.

The reality is that they should (in theory) be pretty low priority as they are a physically isolated island nation and seemingly have local spread contained.  (in theory) the vaccine distribution should probably go to higher risk people.

I mean, if we're talking about saving lives here.  That kind of puts New Zealand and Taiwan more or less at the bottom of the list for the time being.  I would think."

830	gbkaoa	fp6nxut	Canada bans assault weapons, including 1500+ models and variants	"Canadian here. To the best of my knowledge (correct me if I'm wrong, please): Automatic weapons are already banned. Any firearm requires licensing. Mace is illegal. Any weapon held with intent for self-defense is illegal (you can not carry a knife for defense). We have another tier of licensing for anything beyond a hunting rifle (more or less). Having that license subjects you to daily automated background checks. All weapons must be locked away, ammo must be separately locked away. There is never a justifiable reason to have your weapon loaded outside of hunting or shooting range. To move a restricted weapon (eg. Hand gun) out of your house, you must contact authorities, follow a designated route to the shooting range (and nowhere else, even stopping for gas) with the weapon locked up in a separate lockbox from your ammo at all times.


I own no guns, and have only been shooting once. I am a very liberal, city dwelling Canadian with no pony in this race, who lived in multiple areas with rampant gun crime. I do not understand what this ban seeks to accomplish. We already have extremely locked down gun licensing, **daily** background checks, transportation restrictions, and extremely anti-personal-safety laws. You can not legally defend your home in Canada. You can not legally own any weapon, including bats or knives, with intent to use them for self-defense in any situation (to the best of my knowledge).

I genuinely want somebody to explain to me how this ban could possibly reduce gun violence here. I am open to changing my view, but know that I've lived in some shady places with lots of gun crime and none of it was with legally purchased guns, because to own anything other than a hunting rifle or shotgun, you subject yourself to random police screenings and daily background checks.

People who know the gun laws, and agree that this will help reduce violent crime Please explain why and I'm happy to learn.

Edit: Corrections from responses!

* Ammo and firearms can be stored together, but never loaded outside range/hunt
* Authorization to transport restricted firearms is more lenient now, allowing predesignated routes, gas stations, and even hotel stays
* Possibly able to carry a weapon (non-firearm), but this is still a bit murky for me"

* bribing politicians + capturing it on video for leverage
* sending girls to seduce opposition candidates - for example, Ukrainian girls

PolyU has just fallen into the hands of HKPF earlier today and who knows what will happen to our friends there, some of us are already being transported to China with the help of MTR earlier this week. So, please don't think we've won just because of this law, we have a long way to go.

Edit: You can help us by spreading the message that this fight is far from over, boycott Chinese products as much as you can (although it’s easier said than done), encourage the media to monitor the situation in HK and have them keep an eye of the brutality of HKPF. If you do have time and money, come to Hong Kong and record what you see, we have much less Chinese visiting us now so there will be a lot more room for you to explore and hotel prices are a lot lower now. Of course, the best thing you can do is to join the protests and gatherings, they should be safe as long as the Police don’t swoop in and screw everything up, but your safety is the top priority. Anyway, thank you all for your support, without you we wouldn’t have come this far.

Edit 2: Yes, this law is going to hurt Hong Kong's economy, but who cares? We young people never benefited from a booming economy anyways. In fact, that's our point, hurting the economy enough so that the government will bend their knees down."

990	94ivyd	e3ll24n	School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	I am a university student from Bangladesh. This student wing of the government party, called Bangladesh Chhatra League, can do whatever they want and are literally above the law. They beat people up over silly reasons, rape women, vandalise cars, and the police do not even touch them. We unfortunately cannot do anything about it—our hands are tied here. How you can help is, if you have any contact at a newspaper agency, please PLEASE ask them to cover stories of how these BCL men are doing whatever they want whenever they want. In the upcoming elections, they will block vote centers and blow up vote numbers for their party forcefully. If anything is not done against BCL, my country will remain a shithole forever.

993	94ivyd	e3lgob7	School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	"I don't live in the country but my whole family and most of my friends are there so this is turning into a horror story since all I can do is be petrified and see things unfold in bits and pieces from random Facebook posts and my mom's frantic phone calls. Some of my friends and their younger siblings joined the protests last I heard, and the rate at which things are deteriorating with literally zero media coverage, both local and international, I'm getting more and more fearful about how this might end up.

I'll try and link some of the latest from intl. media: [Al-Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/08/bangladesh-mass-student-protests-deadly-road-accident-180802174519088.html), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45048012), [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/08/04/police-protesters-clash-in-bangladesh-capital-many-injured.html), [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/03/teenagers-bring-parts-of-bangladesh-to-a-halt-with-bus-death-protests).

The most concerning thing in all of those articles is how the government backed brutality and murders are being covered up and not reported by anyone. And all this because the bus drivers do not want to get driving licenses, follow basic traffic rules and not be penalised for hit and run injury and/or deaths.

Edit: Please help us get this news out to the world. We are a very small country, only known for our massive garments industry safety fuck up. The government doesn't care about the children, they'll keep torturing them. This will only resolve if the international community puts pressure on the government and force them to stop!"

"Long time lurker finally making a post, because I feel powerless and unable to do anything more for my countrymen.

I am seeing videos where an entire group of girls(100-200) have sought refuge in the garage section of a housing complex being unable to get out due to it being surrounded by BCL(the goons masquerading as students to sow discord among the actual protesters).

In case you gentlemen were not aware, these students protesting for the past few days were actually checking licenses, making spaces for emergency vehicles and actually making this usually urban shithole an actually respectable looking place. They were diverting traffic, making the cars and other vehicles proceed in an orderly fashion and I even saw an instance where an entire crowd of students were making way for a disabled lady on a rickshaw to proceed unhindered. They were cleaning up after themselves to an unprecedented extent that would make even the Japanese World Cup fans blush in shame and this is the protest that our """"""""Government"""""""" has decided to murder, maim, beat and rape to break our spirit.

These are truly troubling times and I fear for the future of a nation that is led by individuals that seem hellbent on ignoring the lessons learned back in 1971."
999	94ivyd	e3lj8ll	School students have been protesting in demand for safer roads for 7 days in Bangladesh. Today, they were outnumbered and attacked by the student wing of the Bangladeshi government.	"For those of you who want a bit of background:

Two buses were 'racing' (for passengers) and killed two students who were simply waiting  for a bus.

A minister's comment further outraged the public. He smiled and wanted to change the topic when journalists brought up the incident. ""A road crash has claimed 33 lives in India's Maharashtra; but do they talk about it the way we do?"" he asked. He wanted to normalise it.

The protests have largely been peaceful. Students took to the roads themselves checking vehicles for licences. They even caught a minister breaking the traffic rules.

What brought things to a boiling point is the amount of violence with which the police and government-affiliated  organisations have used against the protestors. Local media is censored. Those trying to film are also threatened with violence. I've been hearing from people that the govt. is trying to shut down social media.

Please try to spread the news, trend on social media whatever is possible. These are minors some as young as 12-13 and the issue is not getting the attention it deserves."
