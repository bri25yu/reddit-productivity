0	k4qide	geax3ef	An anti-gay Hungarian politician has resigned after being caught by police fleeing a 25-man orgy through a window	"“I ask everyone not to extend it to my homeland, or to my political community”

How can we not draw links to your political affiliation, chief? You fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights only to be caught fucking TWENTY-FOUR men.

Are we meant to just conveniently gloss over that minor detail?"	"> fought tooth and nail to erase gay rights

Worse - ~~he sued, and won, a defamation lawsuit 5 years ago~~ for $7,500 because someone called him gay.

EDIT: my Hungarian is terrible and the tweet I read was incorrect. This politician - 5 years ago, he and 1 or 2 other party members were accused of being gay, the case hinged on privacy, not slander/sexual-orientation, and the accuser/outer lost it and the appeal because of that, and had to pay some damages to some of the people. The court then didn't have to rule on the guy's hypocrisy, but this week the court of public opinion does get to decide about the naked, bleeding, 'ecstatic' Jozsef Szajer who was feeling a police raid from an orgy of 20+ men.

He's now #1 on [gayhomophobe.com](https://gayhomophobe.com/)

*According to the first-instance verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page and pay a damages of two million forints (plus interest). It has not been established that whether the district mayor was really gay, no one tried to prove it. However, according to the judge, this is not the issue either, the statement was made in an environment that is likely to damage the politician's reputation. Klára Ungár will not accept the verdict, she will appeal.*

*Klára Ungár, a former SZDSZ politician, insulted Máté Kocsis VIII. district Fidesz mayor had a good reputation when he claimed in May that he was gay - said on Friday the first instance of the Metropolitan Court. According to the verdict, Ungár must apologize on his own Facebook page, delete Kocsis' name from the disputed entry, and pay HUF 2 million (plus interest) in damages, as well as litigation costs (HUF 88,900) and fees (HUF 120,000).*

*Judge Peter Fintha-Nagy said in his oral reasoning that the lawsuit was not about anyone being disadvantaged because of their sexual orientation. According to him, the lawsuit was about a claim that Máté Kocsis is gay, but he does not undertake to do so, and in fact he does not oppose discrimination against other gays. This, in this context, is likely to damage the reputation of a politician, the judge said, but at the same time refrained from asking Hungary to apologize in an MTI statement.*"	exploration

Over 100 news agencies sitting in 100 contries all over the world are disclosing the panama papers tonight at the exact same time. This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to

Before reading further: 
Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:

>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.

*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*

Edit: 'Die Zeit' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)

Edit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents. (Even if someone is speaking in the video very calm there is really disturbing stuff in there like people trafficking and sex slavery etc...)

Edit3: [here](https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs)  are some graphs generated from the data showing it goes back to the 80s. The official site is very informative and what is in there. I guess they will also have them for download somewhere...

edit4:

big hands to /u/AsshatVik composing the list of head of states (as /u/kaisermatias said, most of the names on the list are head of governments not head of states...):
    
    The 12 heads of state are:

    Mauricio Macri, president or Argentina.

    Bidzina Ivanishvill. ex PM of Georgia

    Sigmundur something something, PM of Iceland.

    Ayad H. Allawi, ex PM of Iraq.

    Ali Abu-Ragheb, ex PM of Jordan.

    Hamad Jasim J.M. Al-Thani, ex PM of Qatar.

    Sheik Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar.

    HRH Prince Salman, King of Saudi Arabia

    Ahmad Al-Nirghani, ex-president of Sudan

    Sultan Al-Nahyan, president of the UAE.

    Pavlo Lazarenko, ex-PM of Ukraine.

    Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine.

    Update of /u/AsshatVik

    Mohammed VI of Morocco might also be involved. Mossack Fonseca created the company to which his personal yatch is registered.


    Family members of Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbajan also used Fonseca to manage mining and real estate investments.
     

    8 High echelon communist party members of People's Republic of China also used their services. Xi Jinping is amongst them, who's linked to two businesses in the British Virgin Islands.





edit 5:
[here](https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/?lang=en) you have a nice website where also Relatives/associates of country leaders of people on the list are listed (which themselves are again on the list)



*obligatory: THANKS FOR THE GOLD STRANGERS!!*



edit 6: **For all germans**. There are germans on the list. No politicians (or other high stake figures) but new evidence on the siemens scandal (from the top of my head I don't know which he was referring to..;D) for example. Mossak Fonseca is helping germans massively in the act of tax evasion.  There is not a single german bank not on the list except ""Sparkasse"" etc... (those who are more or less government affiliated) **for non germans** not all names are already leaked since the journalists give those on the list the opportunity to comment on the accusation. (as seen with the pm of iceland)

"From the ""About the Panama Papers"" section on the site, in case you want a quick summary: ""Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.

In the months that followed, the number of documents continued to grow far beyond the original leak. Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.

The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes."""	Interesting that the source doesn't ask for money or anything on return. They just wanted to leak it. Imagine what kind of person would do this and what they must be feeling right now. An idealist?

Urban warfare tips from a former Marine.  
I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can’t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.  
For the defenders of Kiev, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :  
1.) Stay out of the steet.  
2.) Stay out of street.  
3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.  
4.) Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.  
5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible.  
6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders.  
7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.  
8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last.  
9.) Don’t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.  
10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it’s much more handy than a rifle.  
11.) Never fire from the same window twice.  
12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don’t expose it.  
13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.  
14.) If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you.  
15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him. 16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.  
17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.  
18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area. 19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.  
20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.  
21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.  
22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.  
I don’t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.  
Glory to Ukraine.  
Edit: A few extras.  
23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.  
24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.  
25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force. 26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.  
27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.  
28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.  
29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. 30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long"	exploration

We need to come together with a unified voice to demand real and tangible change for the police. 

We must:

1) Demand civilian Oversight for all police actions

2) Create Equality before the law for police and citizens

3) Encourage De-Escalation tactics to save the lives of the people they should be serving

4) Incentivize Reporting because the police need to have a duty to the public

5) Mandate Transparency because when the rules are broken we need to know about it to hold them responsible

&#x200B;

With these 5 points we can create a nation where the police serve the people.

>The sale of teargas and rubber bullets specifically is conducted via an “open licence” system meaning the value of exports is not made public – in total three separate licences were approved for this equipment.

>Britain has also licensed £800m of small arms to the US since 2010, a proportion of which campaigners say is likely to have been for police use. The exports have included assault rifles, sniper rifles and other guns. Licences have also covered around £2m in security goods such as riot shields.

Adrian Zenz.  
  
Can’t speak or read Chinese but is the leading expert in “Uighur concentration camps”, his other hobbies include being a religious nutbag you literally believes he is on a mission directly from God to defeat Beijing, and he has written a book titled “Worthy to Escape: Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation” about how the fall of capitalism and abortion will bring the anti-Christ to earth.  
  
He’s also a leading figure in the “victims against communism memorial foundation”.. so I’m sure he’s not biased against China whatsoever... 
  
Can’t believe people just eat up all this propaganda about muslims being genocided and the existence of concentration camps. It ALL comes from this one crazy religious guy.  
  
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/15/asia/united-nations-letter-xinjiang-intl-hnk/index.html  
  
Westerners come off as so fucking stupid when articles like this say that 37 Muslim countries have sent envoys to China to inspect the camps personally and have all condoned and declared that no human rights violations are happening and the Muslim’s in the camps are being treated equally and fairly, yet apparently *that’s* the propaganda?
  
Americans need to shut the fuck up. They don’t care about muslims. They’ve spent the last few decades invading the middle-east and slaughtering millions of innocent muslims, destabilising and toppling entire countries and bringing rise to terrorist groups like ISIS. But a little bit of propaganda in their news telling them “cHiNa Is KiLlInG mUsLiMs!” and suddenly they’re all pro-Muslim and think China needs to be invaded to save the muslims?  
  
Don’t make me laugh. America is just trying to manufacture consent to start a war. They’re desperate to point fingers at anything but the fact their country is burning to the ground because of administration inaction and racial inequality."	exploration

Jokes aside, in reality what he criticizes is the mix of money and addiction, not loot boxes. It's not quite as ridiculous as the headline makes it out to be.

Unfortunately, it also means that $2100 for Darth Vader is ok, as long as EA explicitly makes him directly obtainable sans lootboxes. In fact, since there seems to be a precise calculation for it, he essentially is. I don't think this really addresses the problem with EA at its core - they just need to make the whaling more straightforward.

It's mostly a materialization of the circlejerk whose fruition, which seems unlikely, would cause more in casualties in games such as Hearthstone, Clash Royale, and Magic: The Gathering than improvements in the industry against EA's overpriced and gameplay devolving P2W / DLC shenanigans.

So essentially, an excuse has been given for a regulatory agency to take a cut out of established gaming markets without really addressing the problem. I would say Reddit to the rescue once again, but I sort of have to agree with the judge on this. Even though it's not likely, it may be a welcome change. Maybe Magic: The Gathering should be a more controlled deck building experience where each deck repertoire is an expansion that focused more on the gameplay than on supply and demand. Maybe doing otherwise should be considered gambling."	Except no one will buy a $2100 vader.	evaluation

So someone extremely close to Epstein, and has been accused by many people of procuring and trafficking children for him is going to come out and say that one of the trafficked girls is lying about who she was forced to have sex with. 

So is she planning on coming out and saying she setup the rapes and so knows exactly who was raping the kids? Is she planning on saying she had absolutely nothing to do with the rapes and didn't know any of it was happening BUT she also knows Prince Pedo didn't do any of it?

Some things to keep in mind from an NZer:

1) sadly we remain a low wage economy comparative to the cost of living - minimum wage increases tend to help most those with jobs for discretionary income such as students who don’t then lose it all to the flow on rise in cost of living caused by it (many businesses have already said they’re putting up their prices). From a single man earning about 3x the minimum wage, I honestly couldn’t fathom trying to survive on it; like many professionals my age I plan to leave the country so that I might one day be able to return with enough cash to actually buy a house in our ridiculously inflated market.

2) the tax change cited is relatively pointless and does not effectively tax the rich. It is weird that an article today would focus on that though, and not far more recent tax changes more purposefully targeting wealthy landowners (can see my post history for more on that). 

The unfortunate truth is NZ is no egalitarian paradise, or “Scandinavia of the South Pacific”, as people like to think - perhaps we were more so 50 years ago but certainly not now. Policy choices designed to dramatically increase and then retain the wealth of the baby bomber generation ensures we never will be again. We have huge discrepancies in health, education and wellbeing outcomes as a result with most non landowning families now stuck in the poverty cycle. 

What we can be proud of though is our relative freedoms (particularly these days with COVID mainly a non factor), lack of corruption, amazing scenery (though we seem to be doing our best to threaten this too) and general safety. We are also good at sailing quickly and rugby too, which we like to focus on instead of those things above."	evaluation

1. Trump is a minority shareholder in this. Vornado Realty Trust, is who’s controlling debt leveraging decisions etc. trump owns 30%.

2. The position the bank took was ~20% of a mortgage.  So for the total debt 6% is chinas share of trumps interest of the buildings value.

3. The bank reported that they collateralized and sold the debt (very common for large commercial deals, banks underwrite) and said it was a discrepancy that they were listed as still having a claim.

Trump isn’t exactly a saint, but the press and democrats don’t exactly give themselves great legitimacy by reposting bullshit that is meaningless. I’m sure my mortgage has been bundled into a CDO and it wouldn’t shock me if 2% of it is held by Carlos Slim. That doesn’t mean I owe Carlos slim any favors.

South Africa is a democracy, yes, as is the US. But a good democracy...

I'm not sure there being a chance high enough to need to consider it, of being kidnapped or shot in all major cities is the sign of a good democracy.

The US is fucked up, and the brutalism and racism of the police in places is horrific... but it's still safer than South Africa."	"

You learn from successes as well as mistakes.

South Africa has had more successes than many expected and more mistakes and failures than it needed. 

There're many factors in that, but to look at South Africa's current state and say that an America divided on racial, classist and economic lines can't learn anything from a South Africa that is struggling with its fair share of the same is pretty limited thinking.

Of course, to even get there, America would have to be willing to admit it's shortcomings and interrogate them, which is a difficult thing to do when you're so in love with being the Greatest Country In The World that even admitting you have shortcomings must be difficult. 

Hubris and arrogance is a big part of why America is the way it is today and looking elsewhere, even at countries experiencing challenges greater than its own, would be very smart indeed"	exploration

The rest of the world expects a higher standard from the US, and deserve to hear what Americans have learned from this. Five Americans died during this event, but so many more have died needlessly, both in the US and around the world, due to the decisions of this egotistical narcissist. US presidents often speak of the widespread impact of their smallest decisions, while this man is functionality unable to care about other people. The US must make amends with its former friends and allies, first by internal action to enforce justice and the rule of law. Second, by reestablishing a working multilateral relationship founded on trust and respect. They can do this by issuing an open report on the failures of this administration and rebuilding the state department. Third, the US must listen to the rest of the world. You do not live in isolation, and the US is not the divine global hegemon your politicians have issued as sacred through rhetoric. If it were any other country, your political establishment would be denounced, sanctioned, and placed on terror watch lists. The world powers would raise military alarm.

Please, I urge you not to fall into the fake belief that socialism is the answer to your problems. The generation of my parents literally had to bleed on the streets to get our generation rid of socialism and ensure a future for us. We all thank them for their sacrifice every single day. 

I just returned from an excursion to Devin Castle in Slovakia, which is at the border between former Czechoslovakia and Austria. It shows all the people who tried to escape socialism while risking their lives, only to be torn apart alive by dogs, or shot to pieces by border guards (if they got lucky). Yet people still kept risking being torn apart by dogs just to escape socialism, they kept thinking of innovative ways to escape (like home-made diving suits which caused the to drown, or home-made rogallos which caused them to be shot to death before their dead bodies even reached the Austrian side of the river). 

The rise of the radical right in the US makes me sick as half of my family suffered immensely in camps the last time it happened in our part of Europe. And the rise of the radical left makes me equally sick as socialists did more harm to us than the nazis ever could. Please, I beg you, don't fall into this trap. My chess coach always said ""A smart man learns from his mistakes, a smarter man learns from mistakes of others"". Please learn from our mistakes, the entire world will benefit from that. Please listen to people who experienced what you wish for. We are not idiots, we are people just like you and we have experienced the thing you are wishing for right now. Please listen to us and trust us, you don't want it. Your children will pay the price for it. Please..."	evaluation

Edit: holy shit guys thanks for all the upvotes and awards!! For the record my kid is 2 years old and has classier tantrums than DJT."	"I've read the leaked executive order, and it looks like Trump is basically trying to level the threat of lawsuits against Twitter to ensure that they don't label his lies as such (because that would constitute editing, which makes them a publisher). But the EO also gives Twitter (and others) a simple out in that it works only on censorship beyond the terms of service. Well, Twitter only allows Trump's tweets to stay up because of their ""public-interest exceptions"" clause, which includes labelling. If they're not allowed to label tweets, then that clause would be removed and Trump's tweets would fall afoul of the ""abusive behavior"" and ""civic integrity policy"" rules that are explicitly included in the TOS, meaning that without labeling, Twitter's only recourse under the TOS would be to start removing Trump's tweets altogether.

TLDR: Toddler throws tantrum, gets his favorite toy taken away while others get to continue playing."	exploration

During the lockdown if you weren't an essential worker you were allowed to leave your home only to go out to get essential supplies like groceries, or to go for a bit of exercise in the local area (i.e. a walk around the neighbourhood).

550	k8dyxc	gey06zk	Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé named top plastic polluters for third year in a row	Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Nestlé named top plastic polluters for third year in a row	"For the third time in a row I cannot believe this article made it to the front page. I know Reddit loves to hate big corporations especially Coca-Cola and has a massive disdain for plastic products, but to see this article with this source of data on the front page once again is really discouraging and really highlights the fact that there are many users who do not read what they upvote.


This article claims that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter**. This is a pretty bold claim, so let's see how they determined that fact:


The article cites a yearly study performed once again in which a supposidly accurate determination of plastic polluters is identified by using plastic bottles that have washed up on beaches. 


This year's study was performed by collecting 346,494 plastic bottles from beaches. Among those, 218,291 of them were able to be identified by brand. Of those identifiable bottles Coca-Cola brand products made up 13,843 of the bottles found on the beach. 

Although many of these smaller numbers are cleverly danced-around or completely omitted in the data source, this comes out to be a total of **4% of the total bottles collected were identified as belonging to Coca-Cola brand products.**


4% may not seem like a lot to begin with, but let's also consider a few other factors: Anyone who has ever been to a store in the past 10 years can tell you with certainty that Coca-Cola brand does a very good job of trademarking their product. Every Coca-Cola brand drink (including their teas, sports drinks, juices, and bottled water) has a unique style plastic bottle, and this is reflected across all of their sizes from 12 oz, to 24 oz, to 2 l bottles. This plastic bottle design makes their product visually different from the competitors' bottles who mostly use the same generic shape. When exposed to saltwater and constant sunlight many plastic bottles fade, fall apart, lose their labels, or the labels fade to clear. Because the bottles are discarded, bottle caps with brands on them are often missing as well. Those that have bottle caps are also usually faded and brand stamps worn away. 


Despite the harsh weathering there is one persistent detail among the bottles that makes them uniquely and easily identifiable and that is **the shape of the plastic bottle itself**. and as we know Coca-Cola is one of the few brands that has a unique easily identifiable plastic bottle shape. What this means in the context of the study is that every single Coca-Cola product bottle from the past decade was easily identified by their bottle shape, however other leading competitor brands which do not feature a unique bottle shape relied entirely on the label print for identification. this means that 100% of the Coca-Cola products found on the beach were correctly identified as Coca-Cola brand products, however it's very likely that only a small percentage of waste from other brand products were able to be identified due to weathering.


So not only are the results fairly insignificant at only 4%, but they are also extremely biased and unreliable.


Using this data the study claimed that **Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluting brand**. Ignoring the flawed data for a moment let's take a look at what this claim means in regards to this particular study with an analogy:


*Imagine you're walking into work one morning and you notice a large pile of cigarette butts lying on the ground around the smoker's pole in the parking lot. Being the good samaritan that you are you pick up the trash. You count that you've picked up 100 cigarette butts. Out of those cigarette butts 37 of them are just plain orange or white design with no identifiable information. However, 63 of them have a brand name or logo printed on them. There's a very large variety of brands, many of which you've never even heard of, however 4 out of the 100 are Marlboro. With all the different brands mixed in Marlboro makes up the largest number of the identifiable cigarette butts.* **Using this information you determine that Marlboro cigarette company must be the number one litter producer in the world.**

______

While the results of the study are interesting and important, they do not and never have supported the claim that Coca-Cola is the number one plastic polluter. Using the data in this way only proves one or more of the following points:

1) Coca-Cola produces the most popular brands of bottled products.

2) Coca-Cola product consumers litter more often than consumers of other products.

3) Coca-Cola brand products have the most easily identifiable plastic bottle.


If the plastic waste found on the beaches was somehow the result of Coca-Cola's factory runoff this headline could be valid, however all it proves is that Coca-Cola products are the most likely to be identifiable when found washed up on a beach."	exploration

If they set out a plan of replacing plastic by something else, it will simply affect their profit margin, causing a reduction in their ability to keep the prices the same as before. The only way these companies can really become socially responsible and en environmentally responsible is if consumers are willing to purchase their products at a réatively higher price. In that way, they’ll be willing to use less plastic and replace it with another material since the increase in price doesn’t affect demand hat much. Before companies become environmentally responsible, we, as consumers, must first be environmentally responsible.	exploration

When he spoke, he said that it's not all 'doom and gloom' and that is why organizations like the WWF exist.

He did a walkabout, asked some kids if they played football. Oh no, it's too violent, we play soccer. He didn't seem impressed with that either and moved on. That was funny in retrospect.

He ordered the school board to give us a day off from school, so he won some fans

I tried telling a teacher at my Junior High the next year that he had visited my elementary school, she called me a liar in front of the whole class. I told her to phone the school, she refused. She asked why he would visit my elementary school, I mentioned the WWF and she got wide-eyed.

* There are no promotions at Aldi. They don't do 50% off, Buy One Get One Free. If you go to Sainsburys with all the promotions you often end up paying way less then the ticket price. Aldi just does away with all of that to show low prices.

* Aldi only stock a limited range of own brand products. Whilst it offers less consumer choice it massively reduces prices. Contracts to supply Aldi are some of the most fought over in the food industry. This is because suppliers know they will not be competing for shelf space, so if Aldi stock it, it will get sold. The limited range also simplifies their supply chain further reducing cost and delays.

* Aldi operate smaller stores in less prime locations. The smaller product range means stores can be smaller so are cheaper to operate/build. The stores are also placed away from high streets often in old industrial estates where property prices are cheaper. Most customers drive so don't care. Aldi also own all their stores so don't have to worry about landlords raising rent.

* Aldi operate a ""Just in time"" supply chain. Stock is unloaded straight off trucks on to shelves. Deliveries are frequent about once every 2 hours. This means they can be fluid with stock. If something isn't selling they can pull it quickly and replace it with something that is.

* All Aldi staff are trained to do every job and are constantly working. They can operate check outs at peak times and unload lorries at off peak. They can clean and stock shelves. This mean they employ less people to keep costs low. Most stores will have max 10 staff working at a time compared to the 100+ in Tesco's or Sainsbury's.

* Everything in Aldi is optimised for speed. Bar codes are placed on every side of a product. Crates are loaded straight on to shelves, instead of carefully placing every item one by one. Checkouts are fast and customers spend less time in store allowing a higher throughput. I personally do my weekly shop in 20 minutes, compared to potentially an hour in tescos.

* Aldi only stock basic groceries. Whilst they do have special buys, these are carefully planned for specific times of year. They don't routinely stock clothing or toys/games. Groceries are predictable as people buy them every week allowing for consistent revenue compared to the unstable nature of fashion/gifts which people only buy a couple time a year.

* Aldi is very good to their staff. Whilst they work hard they are also paid way above the industry average. They provide a good work/life balance and regular training and other benefits. The Aldi Area manager grad scheme is one of the most competitive in the country. They offer a £44,000 ($56K) starting salary and company car, rising to £77,000 after 3 years ($99K). As a grad you start at the bottom stocking shelves, quickly doing every job up till Area manager of around 5-6 stores. This is not just to be nice, it attracts the best candidates for the job.


Basically the whole company is designed to reduce costs which means they can offer low prices to customers"	exploration

Of course, I received dozens of hate, angry comments and accusations of pro-Russian propaganda (it wasn't), but also a few messages from skeptical and analytical thinking guys.

It's great to see that the denials have finally been published.

Today's ""View from Moscow"" will be dedicated to our protest, condemnation and disagreement with the actions of Putin, a bastard, who turned a conflict situation that could and SHOULD be resolved diplomatically into a bloody senseless war with our brothers, a war in which our children and husbands die .Yesterday, I quite succinctly (as it seems to me) designated Russia as the country of Lieutenants Dan Taylors from Forrest Gump. Guys ready to die in senseless wars at the behest of their government because it has always been that way. But do you know what's the matter? Guys of Ukraine keep excellent! Precisely because Ukraine-the same type of thinking. The military of both countries are historically able and accustomed to fight, they are not afraid and do not plan to capitulate at the first threat. That is what makes them heroes now.

**But it also seems very important to me now to understand that the current military leadership (not soldiers!) of both countries has a lot of common roots, common histories, principles that were brought up in them by the country in which these people were born. And this country (not Russia and not Ukraine) is the USSR, because generals, colonels, special services, leaders of military propaganda, practically all the highest ranks are people over 45-50 years old.**

**These people studied in military academies TOGETHER. Scouts and propagandists literally sat at neighboring desks in the KGB agent school. Western citizens, born in normal societies, with humanism and democracy - it is simply impossible for you to understand WHAT IT IS. And this is a whole huge terrible and absolutely anti-human philosophy. It is a system in which a person's life, his freedom, his will and the right to vote, his human rights are worth nothing. WORTH NOTHING AT ALL.**

*I really want this war to end. Not a single one of my acquaintances needs the territories of Ukraine or their population, they don’t need a war in which loved ones die, they don’t need all this economic collapse and life with the need to risk their lives and freedom every day  protesting and being a part of trash for the sake of the ambitions of a crazy dictator. But I am also sure that right now we are torturing captured Ukrainian soldiers, and they are torturing Russians. We commit war crimes - and they commit them too. We are certainly violating some articles of the laws on war crimes - and so are the Ukrainians. And this is not propaganda, this is exactly THAT reason why the people of both countries want to end this war - we know our ""generals"" really well.*

**Nothing will be changed** ***Until KGB generation that grew up and read THOSE TEXTBOOKS becomes too old or dies. Because as long these guys have their power: conflicts and actions during them will never be humanistic and legitimate.***

**They really have a certain right to some of these actions - we are the invaders, for the whole world - it was we who invaded first. But in any case, any war crime is a crime against humanity.**"	"Forget downvotes lol. Admins literally permaban accounts for that reason.

Not even close.

Even if a miracle happened and we stopped all our emissions there'd still be about 40 years of warming (caused by our emissions) due to climate lag. Bad news is we have emitted more CO2 in the last 40 years than the previous 150.

On top of that we have climate feedbacks which have been triggered and will keep on warming the atmosphere for an indeterminate time (decades, maybe centuries). See permafrost methane for example.

On top of that we have an indeterminate amount of cooling caused by aerosols we have emitted from our industrial activity. IIRC the last number I read was about 0.9ºC of cooling which would mean that global warming is way more advanced that previously though.

670	dr09w3	f6ezvqi	Microsoft Japan’s experiment with a 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40%.	As a teacher, I would love four day school weeks, but I wouldn't want longer days. Instead, I would rather they go year-round. My school district used to have several schools like this and they had the best schedule. Spring break was two weeks instead of one, and summer break was only three or four weeks. Students didn't lose as much of what they had learned, and both they and the teachers got a week break every 10 weeks or so. The district eliminated these schedules a couple years ago and put them back on the traditional calendar like everyone else, I suspect to save money. It costs more to staff non-salaried employees and heat/cool when people are in the buildings more days out of the year. Such a shame.	"Losing knowledge over the summer break was a big problem for me as a kid. Not so much in the sense that I would fall behind (the school took that into account), but because I felt sad about forgetting the things I'd learned. 

Summer vacations were 6 weeks here, but actually more like 8 weeks because the week before the holiday nothing got done and hours were short, and the week after was just a bunch of introduction and usually started on Wednesday or something. 

I also generally felt like we had too many holidays and I got super bored. Though this feeling disappeared when I went to college and we actually had to study for a ton of exams during our what-would-be-holiday."	evaluation

These Ukrainian youths with dreams wide as seas--

There on Snake Island they made their last stand

Morgan. “Take a few minutes, understand where it's coming from -- is it coming from this region?” 

The only problem I have with this quote is that you CAN'T tell where the suppliers are from unless they have public documents regarding them. For example, I buy clothes that are ""handcrafted in Canada"" but nowhere on Reigning Champs' website does it ever say where the cotton is coming from. A price by itself is not an indicator of slave cotton. You can probably expect it from fast fashion shops but who here would be honestly surprised if more luxury brands used it too without consumers knowing?"

No, over protectionism. Which is fine, but just say it like it is. If it was about slave labour, then [this](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/23/prisoner-speak-out-american-slave-labor-strike) practice would have been banned long ago:

>Anybody convicted of a crime after 1865 could be leased out by the state to private corporations who would extract their labour for little or no pay. In some ways that created worse conditions than under the days of slavery, as private corporations were under no obligation to care for their forced labourers – they provided no healthcare, nutritious food or clothing to the individuals they were exploiting.

>Though I've always refused to engage in this modern slavery myself, I've witnessed plenty of examples of it. The most extreme were in Texas and Florida, where prisoners are forced to work in the fields for free, entirely unremunerated.

>They are cajoled into chain gangs and taken out to the fields where they are made to grow all the food that inmates eat: squash, greens, peas, okra. They are given primitive hand-held tools like wooden sticks and hoes and forced to till the soil, plant and harvest cotton.

>They are watched over all day by guards on horseback carrying shotguns. Elite posses of prisoners are used to keep other prisoners in line, through open coercion and violence.

>Prisoners who do not agree to such abject slavery are put in solitary confinement. I know from personal experience. Apart from six months when I was in general population in Oregon, I have been held in isolation cells without pause since 1994."	Also, the US would close their prisons, where they are actively exploiting slave labor by putting people to work who committed minor crimes and shouldn't be there.	evaluation

and isnt most gun crime in Canada done with pistol just like the U.S?"	">doesn't Canada have extreme vetting, magazine restrictions, permits, travel/range restrictions when it comes to firearms?

Yes,and no, depends on the gun type.  You get your ass opened up and inspected by the RCMP when you get your gun license.  Canadian gun owners don't typically have a problem with this. 

there's magazine restrictions.  Most Canadian gun owners don't typically have a problem with this.

Permits, travel restrictions?  Whole different ballgame there.  There are three basic gun classifications - non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited.  Non-restricted are elmer fudd guns - shotguns and rifles, and that's what almost every Canadian gun owner has.  You can buy and sell those through the mail, and drive around with it unloaded in your lifted truck if you want.  Restricted are basically handguns. You can't do shit with those.  Storage is insane.  Travel restrictions are insane.  You have to do stuff like call the police every time you move the gun, and the only place you can move it is between the storage facility and a licensed range.  handgun restrictions are so tight that most people won't own them as you really can't do anything with them.  Prohibited are the auto/non-consumer guns. And again, most Canadian gun owners have no problem with the inability to access handguns.

There's three things that get dismissed/ignored that gets canadian gun owners pissy.  First, uneducated folks complain about 'guns', not appreciating that for most of us, guns are shotguns and hunting rifles and not handguns.  Secondly, shootings are often done with illegal guns (and illegal handguns).  Ramping up restrictions on elmer fudd's grandfather's rifle does not address the problem of illegal handguns - it's posturing.  And lastly, calling this stuff assault style is really showing ignorance.  The stuff that people call assault style is cosmetic, not functional.   Proof?  Which of these is the assault gun?

[This one?](https://285664-883242-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bfc611_cecca599f3064de5bb4ac5f2bdfbf736mv2.png.webp)[Or this one?](https://mk0zahalorgpmyadqs6p.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FAB-Defense-Remington-870-Polymer-Rail-System-Handgaurd-green-rifle.jpg)

"In another thread someone pointed out that there aren't enough people hoarding to cause supply issues, and that the shortages are caused by everyone stocking up for 2-4 weeks all at once.

People tend to convenience buy - they buy enough perishables for a few days, non-perishables are replenished once or twice a week.

In addition, people eat out, and their children eat at school. College students were only expected to be at home for 1-2 weeks for spring break.

Now with everyone buying one or two extra of everything, in addition to having to prepare more meals for more people, and with college students at home sooner and for longer than originally anticipated, people have to buy more than they usually would. And to reduce the number of grocery outings because they've been cautioned to do so, they buy all at once instead of the usual behavior of 2-3 grocery trips a week. So, if, for during a normal week you buy 1 can of tomatoes for dinner meals, you are now buying 2 cans of tomatoes for 1 weeks worth of meals - but if you stock for 2 weeks, that 4 cans.

The store also have to adjust to this change in purchasing pattern and demand, and in turn so do their suppliers. Some suppliers may do so more easily, but others may have a harder time doing so. There is only so much milk that can be milked out of a cow, and the same will be true of other perishables. And you have to keep in mind these places maybe also be experiencing personnel shortages, or *their* suppliers are - if for instance, if the wood pulp or recycled paper suppliers are either working at half capacity, or unable to meet demands that exceed their max capacity, that trickles up to the store."	exploration

"Also for anyone who tells you that ""Net Neutrality is solving a problem that doesn't exist""... or anything along those lines:

Here's a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:

MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.

COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.

TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.

AT&T: From 2007–2009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.

WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.

MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.

PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 

AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.

EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 

VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

AT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T’s own products. 

VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

These are atrocities against humanity. Please, I beg you; any journalist you know, any politician, anyone who can create pressure; let them know about us. If I survive; I will post here again and let you know what happened, if I dont comment; I am either in hospital or dead. If you need evidence; there are 100s of pictures and videos of assault on students all over facebook; take a look at how they beat up women and children. They are not humans. They are monsters.

1075	dbqgb0	f258m0g	Protester shot in chest by live police round during Hong Kong National Day protests	I can't imagine attacking cops with a metal pipe and expecting a good outcome. Protest sure. But for every action there is a reaction.	Yeah, if you boil the boot, and put a little salt on it, it goes down easier.	evaluation

The first video available was shot from behind the victim and appeared to me to be self defense. I was waiting for more context and here it is. 

Important to note:

There is a police officer on the ground being mobbed. 

One of his colleagues rushes in with his sidearm drawn and pointed at the protestors, finger on the trigger. In his left hand he is holding an M870 shotgun, presumably loaded with less lethal munitions. 

That is the crux of the matter - if he wanted to save his colleague and NOT murder someone, he could have put a beanbag round into a protestor - a loud noise and a hard thump, one protestor on his arse and the rest will back off. 

But he didn't. He made a conscious decision to pull his sidearm loaded with live rounds and target the protestors directly. He went in wanting and ready to shoot someone. 

If he had been even an inch lower that 16 year old would be dead. He's currently in critical condition with a collapsed lung and a .38 lodged just above his heart.

When I was a 16 year old boy in Hong Kong my priorities were homework and computer games. 

The fact that thousands of 16 year old boys have to fight to protect their freedoms is deplorable. 

The fact that one might die because the HKPF have lost control of a situation they have consistently escalated and exacerbated is inexcusable.

If this was America she wouldn't be in the Hospital cause she'd be dead at the scene with 20 bullet holes.

1079	dbqgb0	f23qh85	Protester shot in chest by live police round during Hong Kong National Day protests	The authorities warned it would be “dangerous to protest” during the celebrations. Human scum.	Tbh I think it's pretty dangerous to try and hit an armed policeman with a metal pole lmao, this clearly isn't some premeditated plan by the authorities	exploration
